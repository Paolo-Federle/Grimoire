(He cannot counter attacks with lower Initiatives if he has already performed an action in the turn. See \u201cDodge,\u201d p. 156 of the <b>World of Darkness Rulebook</b>, for rules on how this circumvents the normal Initiative order for the turn.)

Such investigation is not normally possible within the same turn in which the spell is cast, although some Time magic might give a mage the extra time needed or clue him in on what spell the caster will cast before he casts it. Vulgar spells do not need this kind of scrutiny; they are obvious enough to counter within the same turn of casting. </p><p>A spell aimed at more than one target does not need to be countered for each target; a successful countering diminishes or prevents its effects against all targets. </p><p>A countering mage must have at least one dot in one of the Arcana used by the attacking spell.

It is safe to assume that most, if not all, Echo Walkers suffer from this addiction.</p><p>The effects on the Sleeper target are long-lasting and brutal. The target becomes depressed, irritable and unable to relate to others as well as he once could. All Social rolls suffer a \u20131 dice penalty until the Sleeper can realign his soul. Doing this requires the target to reaffirm his connection to the rest of humanity, meaning that some people can correct the damage within a few hours (a loving father, for example, might find that spending an afternoon caring for his children does the trick, while an ER doctor might save someone\u2019s life and repair the damage). Other people can help the person realign his soul \u2014 therapy, spiritual counseling or simply positive attention can shift the victim\u2019s soul back into place (this might require a roll of, for instance, Manipulation + Empathy for counseling or Intelligence + Medicine for psychiatric help, though it\u2019s worth noting that pharmaceutical remedies don\u2019t help matters). People who lack the tools to fix the damage themselves, however, often make it worse.

The process and form of the ritual is different for each realm, and is discussed in detail under the appropriate realm sections. <p>Before beginning the ritual, the player must decide upon how many successes the mage will attempt to accrue. The formula is as follows: </p>The mage needs 10 successes to open the gateway. Every additional success has one of the following effects: <ul><li>Extend the duration in which the being can remain in the Fallen World without suffering damage. Each success adds 30 minutes. If the mage allocates no successes to this duration, the being begins taking damage immediately.</li><li>Protect the gateway from Abyssal intrusion. Every success thus allocated allows the player to make one additional roll without the Storyteller checking for the Abyss creeping into the gateway. </li></ul>In addition, the following factors add to the necessary total: </ul><li>Add one success per Sleeper present. In addition, a Sleeper\u2019s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player\u2019s descriptions of his character\u2019s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage\u2019s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character\u2019s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character\u2019s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage\u2019s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start \u2014 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim\u2019s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim\u2019s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned \u201chome,\u201d the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell \u201copen\u201d is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough \u2014 the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50\u2019 of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis.

However, as soon as the item is out of the Awakened character\u2019s possession, it may try to find its way \u201chome.\u201d So, if your foe happens to put the Loyal Possession down on a desk or side table, for example, the Loyal Possession might get picked up by a Sleeper servant or bystander, knocked out a window or into the garbage and so forth, slipping the net to start its journey back.</p> <p>Finally, a Loyal Possession brought inside a ward (see <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>, p. 236) loses its \u201cfix\u201d on its owner and cannot continue to return until the item is brought outside the ward, and the item can\u2019t influence events to help bring it outside.

The process and form of the ritual is different for each realm, and is discussed in detail under the appropriate realm sections. <p>Before beginning the ritual, the player must decide upon how many successes the mage will attempt to accrue. The formula is as follows: </p>The mage needs 10 successes to open the gateway. Every additional success has one of the following effects: <ul><li>Extend the duration in which the being can remain in the Fallen World without suffering damage. Each success adds 30 minutes. If the mage allocates no successes to this duration, the being begins taking damage immediately.</li><li>Protect the gateway from Abyssal intrusion. Every success thus allocated allows the player to make one additional roll without the Storyteller checking for the Abyss creeping into the gateway. </li></ul>In addition, the following factors add to the necessary total: </ul><li>Add one success per Sleeper present. In addition, a Sleeper\u2019s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player\u2019s descriptions of his character\u2019s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage\u2019s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character\u2019s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character\u2019s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage\u2019s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start \u2014 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim\u2019s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim\u2019s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned \u201chome,\u201d the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell \u201copen\u201d is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough \u2014 the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50\u2019 of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>",DescrizioneBreve:"(Acanthus only) call a Moira from Arcadia, with difficulty"},{Titolo:"Superlative Luck",Arcana:"Fate \u2022\u2022\u2022",DescrizioneAlta:"The mage\u2019s endeavors are blessed with amazing luck that defies the odds and credibility.",Practice:"Weaving",Action:"Instant",Duration:"Prolonged (one scene)",Aspect:"Vulgar",Cost:"1 Mana",DescrizioneMiddle:"The mage gains the 8-again quality (reroll results of 8, 9 and 10) on one future dice roll per success achieved in the spellcasting roll.

The process and form of the ritual is different for each realm, and is discussed in detail under the appropriate realm sections. <p>Before beginning the ritual, the player must decide upon how many successes the mage will attempt to accrue. The formula is as follows: </p>The mage needs 10 successes to open the gateway. Every additional success has one of the following effects: <ul><li>Extend the duration in which the being can remain in the Fallen World without suffering damage. Each success adds 30 minutes. If the mage allocates no successes to this duration, the being begins taking damage immediately.</li><li>Protect the gateway from Abyssal intrusion. Every success thus allocated allows the player to make one additional roll without the Storyteller checking for the Abyss creeping into the gateway. </li></ul>In addition, the following factors add to the necessary total: </ul><li>Add one success per Sleeper present. In addition, a Sleeper\u2019s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player\u2019s descriptions of his character\u2019s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage\u2019s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character\u2019s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character\u2019s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage\u2019s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start \u2014 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim\u2019s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim\u2019s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned \u201chome,\u201d the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell \u201copen\u201d is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough \u2014 the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50\u2019 of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>",DescrizioneBreve:"(Obrimos only) call a Seraph from the Aether, with difficulty"},{Titolo:"Supernal Hack",Arcana:"Forces \u2022\u2022\u2022 + Matter \u2022\u2022\u2022",DescrizioneAlta:"Computer data is a unique amalgam of information stored in an Forces-based media within a Matter-based framework.

Such investigation is not normally possible within the same turn in which the spell is cast, although some Time magic might give a mage the extra time needed or clue him in on what spell the caster will cast before he casts it. Vulgar spells do not need this kind of scrutiny; they are obvious enough to counter within the same turn of casting. </p><p>A spell aimed at more than one target does not need to be countered for each target; a successful countering diminishes or prevents its effects against all targets. </p><p>A countering mage must have at least one dot in one of the Arcana used by the attacking spell.

The process and form of the ritual is different for each realm, and is discussed in detail under the appropriate realm sections. <p>Before beginning the ritual, the player must decide upon how many successes the mage will attempt to accrue. The formula is as follows: </p>The mage needs 10 successes to open the gateway. Every additional success has one of the following effects: <ul><li>Extend the duration in which the being can remain in the Fallen World without suffering damage. Each success adds 30 minutes. If the mage allocates no successes to this duration, the being begins taking damage immediately.</li><li>Protect the gateway from Abyssal intrusion. Every success thus allocated allows the player to make one additional roll without the Storyteller checking for the Abyss creeping into the gateway. </li></ul>In addition, the following factors add to the necessary total: </ul><li>Add one success per Sleeper present. In addition, a Sleeper\u2019s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player\u2019s descriptions of his character\u2019s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage\u2019s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character\u2019s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character\u2019s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage\u2019s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start \u2014 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim\u2019s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim\u2019s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned \u201chome,\u201d the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell \u201copen\u201d is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough \u2014 the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50\u2019 of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>",DescrizioneBreve:"(Thyrsus only) call an Atavism from the Primal Wild, with difficulty"},{Titolo:"Transfer Median Features",Arcana:"Life \u2022\u2022\u2022",DescrizioneAlta:"The mage can give a median life form features from another median or base life form.

Such investigation is not normally possible within the same turn in which the spell is cast, although some Time magic might give a mage the extra time needed or clue him in on what spell the caster will cast before he casts it.

The process and form of the ritual is different for each realm, and is discussed in detail under the appropriate realm sections. <p>Before beginning the ritual, the player must decide upon how many successes the mage will attempt to accrue. The formula is as follows: </p>The mage needs 10 successes to open the gateway. Every additional success has one of the following effects: <ul><li>Extend the duration in which the being can remain in the Fallen World without suffering damage. Each success adds 30 minutes. If the mage allocates no successes to this duration, the being begins taking damage immediately.</li><li>Protect the gateway from Abyssal intrusion. Every success thus allocated allows the player to make one additional roll without the Storyteller checking for the Abyss creeping into the gateway. </li></ul>In addition, the following factors add to the necessary total: </ul><li>Add one success per Sleeper present. In addition, a Sleeper\u2019s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player\u2019s descriptions of his character\u2019s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage\u2019s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character\u2019s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character\u2019s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage\u2019s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start \u2014 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim\u2019s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim\u2019s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned \u201chome,\u201d the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell \u201copen\u201d is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough \u2014 the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50\u2019 of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>",DescrizioneBreve:"(Moros only) call an Apeiron from Stygia, with difficulty"},{Titolo:"Transmute Earth",Arcana:"Matter \u2022\u2022\u2022",DescrizioneAlta:"The mage can transmute one common solid substance into another common solid substance.

The process and form of the ritual is different for each realm, and is discussed in detail under the appropriate realm sections. <p>Before beginning the ritual, the player must decide upon how many successes the mage will attempt to accrue. The formula is as follows: </p>The mage needs 10 successes to open the gateway. Every additional success has one of the following effects: <ul><li>Extend the duration in which the being can remain in the Fallen World without suffering damage. Each success adds 30 minutes. If the mage allocates no successes to this duration, the being begins taking damage immediately.</li><li>Protect the gateway from Abyssal intrusion. Every success thus allocated allows the player to make one additional roll without the Storyteller checking for the Abyss creeping into the gateway. </li></ul>In addition, the following factors add to the necessary total: </ul><li>Add one success per Sleeper present. In addition, a Sleeper\u2019s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player\u2019s descriptions of his character\u2019s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage\u2019s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character\u2019s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character\u2019s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage\u2019s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start \u2014 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim\u2019s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim\u2019s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned \u201chome,\u201d the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell \u201copen\u201d is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough \u2014 the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50\u2019 of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>",DescrizioneBreve:"(Mastigos only) call a Wraith from Pandemonium, with difficulty"},{Titolo:"Telepathic Alarm",Arcana:"Mind \u2022\u2022\u2022",DescrizioneAlta:"When this defensive magic is installed in an object, a telepathic connection opens between the item\u2019s owner and any unauthorized person coming into contact with it.

The process and form of the ritual is different for each realm, and is discussed in detail under the appropriate realm sections. <p>Before beginning the ritual, the player must decide upon how many successes the mage will attempt to accrue. The formula is as follows: </p>The mage needs 10 successes to open the gateway. Every additional success has one of the following effects: <ul><li>Extend the duration in which the being can remain in the Fallen World without suffering damage. Each success adds 30 minutes. If the mage allocates no successes to this duration, the being begins taking damage immediately.</li><li>Protect the gateway from Abyssal intrusion. Every success thus allocated allows the player to make one additional roll without the Storyteller checking for the Abyss creeping into the gateway. </li></ul>In addition, the following factors add to the necessary total: </ul><li>Add one success per Sleeper present. In addition, a Sleeper\u2019s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player\u2019s descriptions of his character\u2019s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage\u2019s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character\u2019s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character\u2019s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage\u2019s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start \u2014 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim\u2019s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim\u2019s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned \u201chome,\u201d the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell \u201copen\u201d is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough \u2014 the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50\u2019 of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>",DescrizioneBreve:"(Obrimos only) call a Cherub from the Aether, with difficulty"},{Titolo:"Target Interloper",Arcana:"Prime \u2022\u2022\u2022",DescrizioneAlta:"The willworker adds a defensive mechanism to anitem, allowing another spell, which must also be cast into the item, to target any unauthorized person touching the device.

The process and form of the ritual is different for each realm, and is discussed in detail under the appropriate realm sections. <p>Before beginning the ritual, the player must decide upon how many successes the mage will attempt to accrue. The formula is as follows: </p>The mage needs 10 successes to open the gateway. Every additional success has one of the following effects: <ul><li>Extend the duration in which the being can remain in the Fallen World without suffering damage. Each success adds 30 minutes. If the mage allocates no successes to this duration, the being begins taking damage immediately.</li><li>Protect the gateway from Abyssal intrusion. Every success thus allocated allows the player to make one additional roll without the Storyteller checking for the Abyss creeping into the gateway. </li></ul>In addition, the following factors add to the necessary total: </ul><li>Add one success per Sleeper present. In addition, a Sleeper\u2019s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player\u2019s descriptions of his character\u2019s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage\u2019s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character\u2019s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character\u2019s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage\u2019s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start \u2014 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim\u2019s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim\u2019s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned \u201chome,\u201d the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell \u201copen\u201d is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough \u2014 the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50\u2019 of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>",DescrizioneBreve:"(Mastigos only) call an Imp from Pandemonium, with difficulty"},{Titolo:"Walls in the Labyrinth",Arcana:"Space \u2022\u2022\u2022, Fate \u2022\u2022, Time \u2022\u2022, Prime \u2022-\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022",DescrizioneAlta:"This spell is an exception to the normal spell-control rules (see \u201cspell control\u201d, <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>, p. 128), allowing the mage to add a \u201cWall\u201d to a pre-existing Ward.

Such investigation is not normally possible within the same turn in which the spell is cast, although some Time magic might give a mage the extra time needed or clue him in on what spell the caster will cast before he casts it.

Next, the Templar speaks the name of the angel after it has been encoded as a cipher. The more important the \u201cmessenger,\u201d the more elaborate the cipher must be. Finally, the Templar makes the hand-sign of the Baphomet when the angel arrives, proving to the angel that he is worthy of witnessing the light of God.<p>The Templar casting this spell makes a single call to a single, specific \u201cmessenger\u201d angel (whose name he may have procured from any number of sources, liturgical or lay, but it must be the angel\u2019s true name). The angel who heeds the call (if the spell is successful) is from the loftier regions of the Shadow Realm but has a singular connection to the Aether, or \u201cHeaven\u201d as the Templar understands it. Obviously, the \u201cangel\u201d is not from the Aether proper, but is savvy to what has occurred there in an up-to-date sense. In the communion with the angel, the Templar may ask the angel any questions that he wishes, and the angel responds with whatever information is salient.</p><p>Of course, mere men surely cannot grasp the full import of what occurs in the Realms Supernal, and the angel\u2019s answers may seem obtuse, incomprehensible, or chaotic. As well, the angel might simply deem the answer to a given question as one the Templar\u2019s mind cannot possibly understand, and may deliberately occlude or withhold information (though it will never lie outright). \u201cWhat does God look like?\u201d is not a viable question for this spell to answer, nor is \u201cWhat is the meaning of life?\u201d In response to this first question, the angel might loose a torrent of incomprehensible Enochian syllables, answering the question honestly, but in the language only the angels can understand. The second question might yield an almost rhetorical response, such as, \u201cTo live in righteous imitation of Christ.\u201d The angels will not be fooled by vain men\u2019s attempts to divine the secrets of heaven.</p><p>Information that may be legitimately gleaned is information that the angel believes men have the context to understand. For example, \u201cIs God angry that we seek the Ten Commandments\u201d is a question that would receive a concise answer, while \u201cHow does God feel about our quest for the Ten Commandments\u201d would elicit either an answer incomprehensible to the Templar or a simple rebuff that \u201cIt is beyond your capacity to know.\u201d</p><p>The answers asked of the angels need not always concern the loftier realms. \u201cIs the Temple Mount the true site of the Temple of Solomon?\u201d is a fine question to ask (the answer to which depends upon the individual chronicle). So is \u201cWhere have the Templars stored their treasures?\u201d Indeed, so is, \u201cWhere are my car keys?\u201d but such a flippant question may well serve to stoke the ire of the angel, and the anger of angels isn\u2019t something any mortal is likely to emerge from unchanged.

Of course, Simon Magus met his end after challenging God\u2019s supremacy, but the Templars are certainly capable of learning from the mistakes of others.<p>Some Templars have taken it upon themselves to learn the celestial speech of the angels, potentially in hopes of tricking the angels to answer their questions with a language they assume the mortals not to comprehend. Again, the angels aren\u2019t so simple as this.

The process and form of the ritual is different for each realm, and is discussed in detail under the appropriate realm sections. <p>Before beginning the ritual, the player must decide upon how many successes the mage will attempt to accrue. The formula is as follows: </p>The mage needs 10 successes to open the gateway. Every additional success has one of the following effects: <ul><li>Extend the duration in which the being can remain in the Fallen World without suffering damage. Each success adds 30 minutes. If the mage allocates no successes to this duration, the being begins taking damage immediately.</li><li>Protect the gateway from Abyssal intrusion. Every success thus allocated allows the player to make one additional roll without the Storyteller checking for the Abyss creeping into the gateway. </li></ul>In addition, the following factors add to the necessary total: </ul><li>Add one success per Sleeper present. In addition, a Sleeper\u2019s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player\u2019s descriptions of his character\u2019s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage\u2019s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character\u2019s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character\u2019s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage\u2019s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start \u2014 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim\u2019s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim\u2019s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned \u201chome,\u201d the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell \u201copen\u201d is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough \u2014 the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50\u2019 of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>",DescrizioneBreve:""},{Titolo:"The Divining Spirit",Arcana:"Spirit \u2022\u2022\u2022 + Time \u2022\u2022\u2022",DescrizioneAlta:"The mage summons a greater spirit from the Shadow Realm, likely unknown to her.

The process and form of the ritual is different for each realm, and is discussed in detail under the appropriate realm sections. <p>Before beginning the ritual, the player must decide upon how many successes the mage will attempt to accrue. The formula is as follows: </p>The mage needs 10 successes to open the gateway. Every additional success has one of the following effects: <ul><li>Extend the duration in which the being can remain in the Fallen World without suffering damage. Each success adds 30 minutes. If the mage allocates no successes to this duration, the being begins taking damage immediately.</li><li>Protect the gateway from Abyssal intrusion. Every success thus allocated allows the player to make one additional roll without the Storyteller checking for the Abyss creeping into the gateway. </li></ul>In addition, the following factors add to the necessary total: </ul><li>Add one success per Sleeper present. In addition, a Sleeper\u2019s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player\u2019s descriptions of his character\u2019s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage\u2019s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character\u2019s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character\u2019s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage\u2019s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start \u2014 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim\u2019s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim\u2019s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned \u201chome,\u201d the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell \u201copen\u201d is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough \u2014 the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50\u2019 of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner\u2019s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>",DescrizioneBreve:"(Acanthus only) call an Anachronism from Arcadia, with difficulty"},{Titolo:"Temporal Shift",Arcana:"Time \u2022\u2022\u2022",DescrizioneAlta:"The mage protects others.

maintained by mankind, toward the world of nature. While others leaf through dusty tomes or gaze into the smooth, polished surfaces of mirrors or glass balls in their secluded sanctums, there are those willing to step outside and draw knowledge and power from a greater world not of their own making. They read their incantations and prophecies in the stir of branches in the wind and the fall of leaves. They draw power and strength from the green, growing world. </div> <div>There is a secret language in nature, and from those who are able to read it nothing in the Fallen World may be hidden, for all things are interconnected and everything is reflected in everything else. Nature displays its treasures for all to see, but unfolds in ways that few can ever fully comprehend, changeless only in its ever-changing evolutions, devolutions and revolutions. The diligent mage may divine the intricate syntax and grandiose grammar of this secret language, glimpsing even deeper secrets in the Mists that enshroud mysteries beyond mortal comprehension. </div> <div>Most would halt or turn back, but some press on into this nature beyond nature, this \u201csupernature,\u201d if you will. In the Mists can be found the implicit order from which the visible world grows, the sleeping giants whose bodies are the land, whose breath is the wind, of whose voices the thunder is but an echo. Here is where the faces of nymphs shine through flower and fruit and leaf, where the dances of sylphs trace breeze and gale, where gnomes churn away at the molten heart of the mountain. This is where magic is born, and even the mightiest mage must tread carefully or not at all. </div>  <div>The Walker in Mists reaches beyond the seen into the unseen, tapping magic at the source of all life as was done in times long forgot.

He knows the deep caverns of the earth where dragons yet sleep, and what ancient invisible roads lead to the fae countries. </div>  <div>It was the Walker in Mists who first taught mankind to mark the trails it followed and to recognize landmarks that could lead unerringly from region to region. Rather than following seasonal growth or available game, mankind could choose its own path to its destiny. In short, he taught us not simply to migrate, but to actually travel. To the more settled folk he gave games of chance \u2014 the vagaries of which teach, in miniature, the mysteries of fate and destiny \u2014 that they too might experience the adventure of the unknown. </div> <div>But with the spread of civilization, mankind forgot the wisdom of the Walker, taking his gifts for granted and detaching itself from the rhythms and cycles of the natural world. Even his games of chance \u2014 once used to divine the very will of the gods themselves \u2014 degenerated into a competitive orgy of materialistic greed, attracting crime and corruption. As broad, well-traveled roads carved up the wilderness and creased the face of the earth, the Walker found it increasingly necessary to rely upon ley lines to guide him invisibly through the Mists from grove to lake to mountain as he visited the few remaining sacred sites.

Although all destinies are shared, all paths leading to destiny are separate. Even teacher and student must part ways eventually. The crossing of paths, therefore, is a momentous occasion inaugurated by lengthy introductions recounting each Walker\u2019s origins and travels, followed by a kind of singing-game in which each takes turns reciting his tutorial lineage until a common spiritual ancestor is found. After that, any food, provisions or contraband carried by each is pooled and shared. Then there may be a general discussion of the omens and portents of the current age, followed by another singing-game in which travel itineraries are compared so that warnings can be given about possible past and future destinations, with particular emphasis on immediate dangers.

Many doubt their very existence, but those who understand their ways can detect their influence throughout the world. Their names are not recorded by history, but much of history was written by them. Their faces may not be found upon monumental statuary, but most monuments are carved according to proportions devised by a Subtle hand. Though they heed no bounds and move by routes unknown, it is their pen that dictates where roads and borders are laid. To some they are skulking villains who dare not show their faces. To others they are the secret chiefs of the great conspiracy that brings the world to order. To themselves, they are simply the Subtle Ones, or the Ahl-i-Batin, the \u201cPeople of the Inner Truth\u201d who serve as the culture-bearers of civilization \u2014 not by bringing the world to order, but by bringing order to the world. </div> <div>Batini magic utilizes sacred geometry to open the mind to divine reality. By studying the complexities of spatial relationships and proportionality, the soul can compose itself to harmonize with the world, and so compose the world. Subtle lore traces itself back to the architects and city planners of Atlantis, for whom sociology was no mere science but a magical art. They believed that a harmonious society that both sustains and fulfills all its members could be achieved through proper patterning of the space it occupies, engendering proper patterns of behavior in occupants. This social engineering concerned itself with everything from broad geographical plans to the minutiae of detail in art, music and literature. Every aspect of culture could be made to reflect \u2014 and so teach and encourage \u2014 greater social harmony. </div> <div>The Subtle Ones exerted substantial influence in all the great civilizations of the world up through the European Renaissance until their power, obtained largely through the work of agents placed within major political and religious institutions, waned as secular society waxed. At present, the Subtle Ones are too few and scattered to enact any of their plans on a large scale, but have learned to keep themselves insinuated into the ever-changing administrations of modern politics, mostly by seizing posts within the intelligence community. They also maintain a constant presence in the worlds of art, fashion, communication and education. From these positions they can control (or at least influence to some nominal degree) the excesses and vicissitudes of society at large. </div> <div>Because the Subtle Ones are so arcane and secretive about themselves, their motives are often called into question by other mages. Their hand has been discerned in innumerable plots and intrigues throughout history, most notably in the Order of Assassins, a deviant sect of Ishmaelite Islam. From its network of impregnable mountaintop fortresses, this group dispatched highly trained operatives to extend its influence, from fanatically suicidal hit men to skilled and patient deep-cover agents. Some consider this sect to be the Subtle Ones\u2019 crowning achievement, a spiritually inclined utopian society sustaining itself in the midst of a hostile social climate with a minimum of military force. Others see the Assassins as the very worst of the Subtle Ones\u2019 work \u2014 secluded and insular, using murder as a tool to separate themselves from the outside world for an autocratic leader who claims overweening spiritual authority while commanding his mind-slaves to kill themselves as a demonstration of his power. The final words of the sect\u2019s founder, the legendary Old Man of the Mountain, Hassan-i-Sabbah \u2014 \u201cNothing is true, everything is permitted!\u201d \u2014 is often taken to indicate the deeply amoral identity of this Legacy. </div> <div>In fact, the Subtle Ones do not hesitate to engage in acts that would be condemned by most spiritual traditions. The Ahl-i-Batin also employ a number of ascetic practices taken to potentially dangerous extremes, including fasting, flagellation and self-mutilation. Their long history of brainwashing, mind control and social manipulation is cause for concern as well. Among their other disciplines, they cultivate the way of the unseen assassin, and are not above using violence or a convincing threat of violence to achieve their aims. Thus, they can be said to wield considerable temporal power. The Subtle Ones do not consider themselves to be the masters of the world, but merely the goad-servants of human evolution, scourging mankind to drive it up the spiritual slope toward an eventual postulated universal Awakening. </div> <div>As to when this will occur, the Legacy presents no clear answer. At present, the prevailing view is that too many secrets have been discovered (or leaked) to the Sleepers too soon, granting humanity a capacity for destruction in disproportionate excess to its current degree of moral development.

Groups do sometimes form for a particular purpose, though; these are tightly knit and highly insular cells so extravagantly surreptitious that each member may not even know the identities of the others. Meetings are conducted with faces veiled and bodies cloaked. Speech never rises above a whisper, and separate routes are taken for entrances and exits. One might ask, with such a pall of secrecy, how the Ahl-i-Batin are able to maintain communications, much less a global conspiracy. The \u201cmaster plan\u201d of the Atlantean social engineers is reiterated throughout Batini lore, such that no inheritor is left without a thorough understanding of the role he is to play in the process of human evolution.

On the contrary, creativity and originality are prized and encouraged both within the Legacy and in the world at large. <div>The local details of the collective plan vary from region to region, even from neighborhood to neighborhood in large cities, so facets must be communicated to newcomers.

With the legends came charlatans, those who claimed to know the trick of getting something for nothing, who were sought out by kings with vacuous coffers, who fleeced their patrons by wrapping their lead ingots in polished brass foil and slipped out of the palace by night with their own empty wealth jingling in their purses. So the legends fell into disrepute (but without ever disappearing entirely) while the quest for empty wealth continued. The truth behind those legends would shock the royal addicts who heard them. Indeed, the mages of Atlantis had learned the \u201ctrick\u201d of transmuting one substance into another, but it was only an incidental side effect of their real work. Their labors were not ultimately directed toward the external material world, but inward. Like land, wood or stone, the human soul can be cultivated and shaped, they found, transformed into something both greater and finer than what it might otherwise be. The \u201clead\u201d that they operated upon was themselves, and the \u201cgold\u201d that they created was themselves. </div>  <div>This is not to say that their \u201calchemy\u201d was a purely contemplative practice, a type of meditation cloaked in a physical metaphor. The image of the secluded chamber with its kiln and clutter of alembic, retort and crucible is factually accurate. Experimentation in the material plane was as much a part of their practice as spiritual discipline. Engaging in a physical craft with an appropriate mindset of self-observation can synchronize changes in both the inner and outer worlds. This Legacy teaches that true understanding is best reached by mirroring the inner process with the outer. </div>  <div>Just as matter can be shaped by heat and cold, by hammer\u2019s blow and chisel\u2019s cut, so too can the soul be shaped by pleasure and pain, by feeling and thought. Emotional baggage or faulty modes of thought can be trimmed away and desirable qualities such as honesty and compassion may be added to the alloy mixture in the crucible of the soul. Imperfection can be burned off, boiled out or frozen and chipped away. The soul\u2019s purest essence may be distilled out of the woes and trauma that weigh it down, leaving it free to become that which is rarer and more precious than gold \u2014 the fulfilling life of the complete person. </div>  <div>Inheritors of this Legacy are known as the \u201cUncrowned Kings,\u201d a term that most outsiders take to refer to the age of the charlatans, when the rulers of the world could be led by their vacuous desires and anyone who knew those desires could easily become a true \u201cpower behind the throne.\u201d But a more esoteric meaning is hidden in the name. Having perfected the technique of crafting their own souls, the Uncrowned could truly claim to be \u201cself-made men,\u201d masters of their own souls. Their \u201croyalty\u201d is based, not upon primogenitore or the hoarding of hollow wealth, but upon the noble qualities that they have cultivated within themselves. They do not rule over nations, but over themselves to a degree that \u201ccommon\u201d folk can scarcely imagine. </div>  <div>The qualifier \u201cUncrowned\u201d is equally significant on an esoteric level, beyond the fact that they do not openly display their unique nobility. The adornment of precious metals and gems is at once a metaphoric image connoting inner nobility and personal power, a reference to the physical transmutations that this Legacy practices. The title is also an oblique suggestion of the halo found in religious iconography denoting a brilliance or radiance of consciousness so bright that it shines directly through the skull (normally visible to those with aura perception but sometimes accessible to Sleepers in a religious context). But these Kings are emphatically Uncrowned, eschewing not only the lauds of their peers, but also the empty wealth that they are capable of creating. </div>",alternateNickname:"Coal-burners",orders:"",appearance:"While Uncrowned Kings may occasionally exhibit a regal demeanor or noble bearing that reflects their inner nature, their outward appearance usually belies such appearance with evidence of the physical toil that occupies their time.

Having penetrated the veil of lies and illusion, they stand upon the threshold of a whole new world so dazzling that they tend to forget their previous mode of existence. They reckon that the old rules no longer apply to them. Admitted into a new confraternity of like souls, they draw away from their families and friends, who cannot understand their new vision and abilities. Now able to transcend the gross limitations of matter and energy, some even neglect their own corporeal bodies, regarding them as a mere hindrances, husks to be discarded once their usefulness has ended. While there is some truth to this way of thinking, it is not a whole truth. It is a road that leads to dissolution and disembodiment. </div>  <div>The Perfected Adepts stand as a warning sign upon that road, reminding all mages where they came from and what their ultimate goal is, or should be. Their presence signifies a return to the source, a remembrance that all mages are still human beings \u2014 they are born, live their lives and die. If magic cannot be made to enrich and fulfill that process, then it is not magic but delusion. The Adepts teach that before one can truly transcend the limitations of being human, one must learn what the true limitations of humanity are. Furthermore, they teach that the wisdom gained through transcendence must be brought back to humanity, so as to enable others to follow the same road. A human being is a work in progress, they hold. Awakening is not the completion of that work, but the opportunity for completion, for perfection. </div>  <div>And yet, the task of perfecting oneself cannot be accomplished while still entangled in the web of lies and illusion. Though the Adepts do not disdain or reject the affairs the material world, they do require a substantial removal in order to pursue their goals. Renunciation of worldly attachments or wealth is the first necessary step for disentangling oneself from the world. Adepts tend to retreat into hermitages or cloistered communities, both magical and mundane, in order to disconnect from influences that distract from self-observation and cultivation. They simplify their lives, shunning extraneous noise and clutter so that they can hear the murmurs of their innermost selves. </div>  <div>Once a suitable degree of quietude and simplification is attained, an Adept begins the process of perfection by concentrating upon the base from which his consciousness springs, his own physical body. With worldly concerns out of the way, the first thing that the Adept may notice are the noises and sensations that come from within his corporeal rame. True calm and peace of mind are not possible while the body exists in a state of discomfort or disease, or even less than optimal health. A strict regimen of adjusted diet and exercise must be undertaken to ensure that the body does not distract from the clarity of the mind. </div>  <div>The Perfected Adepts consider martial training to be the most effective type of physical exercise for their purposes. In addition to building strength and flexibility, the student is taught to focus mind and body to function as a unified whole. Besides enhancing the capability of the body, martial arts have a calming effect upon the mind by instilling knowledge and confidence to deal with direct physical threats. Discipline and perseverance, also necessary in magical training, are encouraged and honed. (Asian martial arts in particular incorporate esoteric elements such as focused meditation and occult physiology that perfectly complement the study of magic.) Most systematized fighting styles around the world include some ethical principles whereby practitioners are exhorted to aid and protect those of lesser ability, an ideal that the Adepts proudly espouse. </div>  <div>As the mind works at perfecting the body, it also learns to operate upon itself, gaining mastery over thought and emotion rather than being ruled by them. Just as the distractions of the outer world can be dispelled, just as the wants and urgings of the body can be quelled, so can the chatter and babble of the lower mind be silenced, leaving the soul free hear what it most needs to tell itself. Only when everything has fallen away can the innermost self be free to seek perfection by uniting the highest reality with the lowest. </div>  <div>To some this union might seem to be the ultimate goal, the reason for a mage\u2019s existence. But for the Perfected Adepts, this is not the end of their work, but the beginning. Perfection is meaningless if it is static and removed from the world, so the Adept is obligated to return to the world and help others to find the way to inner peace. The Adept\u2019s martial prowess makes him a natural champion and protector, but perfection is not bound to any one role. The patience and discipline that mark an Adept\u2019s training make him suitable for a number of callings, from the most repetitive of mindless menial labor to the most arcane and convoluted of intellectual pursuits such as science or philosophy.

They passed on a part of their curse to their vessels, infecting the mages with the most virulent aspect of their unique Abyssal damnation. The mages, though not undead, had placed one foot firmly on the far side of the grave and found their souls eroding away into the great darkness beyond all light. The spiritual vacuum thus created eventually spread to their outward forms, consuming their bodies until some of them ceased to exist, or else wandered the earth as hungry ghosts.

It is extremely rare for a young or even middle-aged mage to make this hideous choice.

If he can regain his own soul and reattach it (using spells, not Tremere attainments) before he raises his Gnosis above the amount of dots he had when he was first initiated into this Legacy, and then if he sacrifices a dot of Willpower, he loses all Tremere attainments and become fully ensouled again. He cannot, however, learn any other Legacy ever again. He cannot engage in soulcraft with a Tremere-touched soul, even though he has overcome the Legacy\u2019s curse.

Negative reinforcement \u2014 pain and deprivation \u2014 requiring constant maintenance for diminishing returns, is extensively employed, while positive reinforcement \u2014 pleasure and reward \u2014 which maintains itself and encourages progress is seldom used, if not rejected outright. Dissent and alternative views are discouraged with such severity that the mere thought of them is stifled even before the thinker can utter them aloud. The modern adult emerges as a mass-produced domesticated robot, interchangeable with any other, his own slave driver and self-censor. The society formed by such people thus becomes an entity unto itself, bearing no responsibility to its disposable individual members, its insular communities enclosed and contained, its communication monitored and information flow regulated by living automata.

And the Liberatores realize that this is only the tip of a most chilling iceberg. For the truth about the human condition, they point to the ghetto and shantytown, to dungeons and basements and shipping containers, to containment camps and torture chambers and rape rooms, to the barbed wire fence between desert and fertile field, to the windowless monolithic building, to the sweatshops of Saipan and the tourist brothels of Dubai, to the eyes of the kiddie-porn \u201cstar\u201d and the screams of the toddler strapped to the racing-camel\u2019s saddle. </div><div>Founded around the time of the American Civil War, the Liberatores claim spiritual descent from slaves that Awakened and helped to organize the Underground Railroad.

Wage slaves and others who are kept in servitude by circumstance and overarching social systems exist in a similar state of being \u201cbrainwashed,\u201d although in such cases the process is more insidious. While they may theoretically be free to change jobs, even careers or lifestyles, they were raised to believe that their options are limited and that the lives they currently lead are the best possible situations that they can hope for. In both cases, their bondage is assured by their artificially narrowed understanding of the world around them. </div<div>The first duty of the Liberatore is to dispel this illusion of limitation, to lift the slave\u2019s mind out of a confinement that is, if not actually self-imposed, at least self-perpetuating. The slave must be aware of and yearn for a fundamentally different way of life or else carry his manacles with him forever even after his body has been freed from physical chains. The Liberatores use the Mind 2 spell \u201cEmotional Urging\u201d to accomplish this, instilling a wish for genuine freedom in the minds of those suffering from both overt and covert enslavement. The intent is to inspire the target with a hope for improving her lot in life. </div<div>Also, the mage has an indefinite-Duration Mind 2 \u201cMental Shield\u201d that protects him (with a number of points equal to his Mind dots) from supernatural attempts to overcome his will.</div>",firstAttainmentOptArcana:"Spirit 2",firstAttainmentOptDescrizione:"<div>Some Liberatores take a more generalized or external approach to this duty by calling upon a spirit to do the work of inspiring the oppressed. Of course, since the Liberatores are Mastigos, that spirit will be demonic in essence; demons have a long mythic history of exclusion, punishment and servitude \u2014 not to mention a vehement hatred of such conditions and a burning desire to escape them. A dedicated and motivated spirit will use its own cunning and powers to inspire the lust for freedom. Furthermore, if the target ever achieves that freedom, the spirit will likely be raised in rank among its peers, and may even gain some degree of permanent identity in the physical world as a symbol of liberation. </div><div>The Liberatore can use an effect similar to the Spirit 2 \u201cLesser Spirit Summons,\u201d although she can only call upon demonic spirits. To do so, she makes an instant Resolve + Intimidation + Spirit roll contested by the demon\u2019s Resistance. The Liberatore who summons such a spirit can also use other magic (such as the higher levels of Spirit spells) to command the spirit or bind it to a particular person, group or place. The contradiction of enslaving a spirit to do the work of freeing others will not be lost on the intelligent spirit, however, and so this tactic is to be avoided. Demons in particular are notorious for adhering to the letter of a command while subverting its intent.

To boost this Attribute, he spends an instant action calling upon his passionate need for freedom; on the following turn (and for the remainder of the scene), he adds his Mind dots to the chosen Attribute.

(Some social psychologists recognize this in the phenomenon of the \u201cinstitutionalized men,\u201d a term often applied to former convicts who violate parole  and commit crimes so that they can trade back their ineptitude at participating in society at large for the comparative security and regularity of prison life.) Some are so deeply conditioned to a social structure of dominance and submission that they incapable of sustaining any relationships that are not inherently manipulative, exploitative or oppressive. For these freed ones, liberation is simply a matter of exchanging a new master for an old one, or else an opportunity to begin exercising power over others as was previously done to them. </div><div>To ensure that the freed can truly become and remain free, much of the efforts of the Liberatores are committed to deconditioning and deprogramming those they liberate.

But the Bokor are not tricksters or jesters. They want power, and they feel that the bodies of the dead provide a good path to that power. </div><div>The word \u201cbokor\u201d is used in the Vodoun faith to refer to a priest or shaman who performs black magic, often for money. Bokor are considered responsible for the \u201czombie powder\u201d that changes a living person into an unliving servant, as well as other well-known maleficent aspects of Vodoun. Curses that bring disease and bad luck, dolls made to resemble the person a bokor wants to harm and the entreaty of spirits to bedevil the bokor\u2019s enemies have all been laid at the feet of these individuals. To what extent did the Bokor Legacy influence these legends? The answer is lost to time, but it is true that the Legacy is strongest in Haiti and other Caribbean nations where some form of Vodoun is in common practice.  The arts of the Bokor are brutal, bloody and effective. They are primarily concerned with preparing living people to become zombies upon death, and with creating those zombies. The Bokor do not, as a rules, care whose bodies they animate. To the Bokor, a person ceases to be a person at the instant of death. The soul departs, and all that is left is matter. That matter can then be animated, given power and tasks.  As the Bokor grow in power, they can gain the ability to kill with a glance, and a potent member of this Legacy may kill a man and turn him into a zombie before his body hits the ground. </div><div>The Bokor\u2019s method of raising a body to service involves nothing more than a glance or a whispered invocation, at least outwardly. Inwardly, however, the Bokor thinks of himself as a king of the dead, able to stride the worlds of the living and the deceased by dint of the Awakening. Raising a body as a zombie, therefore, is no different than calling an obedient dog. While some Bokor take the time to paint corpses with glyphs (often in blood or wet flour) in order to ensure that their service continues longer than an hour or so, others rely on their skill alone to create lasting servants. </div><div>Despite the Bokor\u2019s blas\xe9 attitude about corpses, the Bokor refuse to have any truck with ghosts. The Bokor believe that ghosts are fragments of human souls, and that by helping a ghost to move on (by destroying  its anchors or severing its connection to them) the Bokor can help the soul to repair itself. If a Bokor discovers that a ghost is anchored to its own corpse, the Bokor will never  raise that corpse as a zombie (though the mage might destroy it). A soul is whole at the moment of death, however, and powerful Bokor can stop the soul from fleeing and bind it back into its now-dead body. This creates a powerful undead creature called a revenant, capable of much more independent and complex action than a standard zombie. Creating a revenant, however, is the only way in which a Bokor feels comfortable affecting a human soul. Severing or holding a soul in an object is taboo  to them. This differentiates them with the bokor of Vodoun, who are infamous for placing souls in clay jars called canari tonnerre and using them to force the souls\u2019 barely living bodies into service. </div><div>Every Bokor has her own grandiose dreams of power. This might involve conquest of a particular area, slaying all the descendants of an enemy or acquisition of wealth, but the goal is very rarely \u201cmagical knowledge.\u201d The Bokor are unabashedly physical and greedy, and look down on such lofty ideals as  wisdom and humility. Unlike their parent Path, they do not see the fragility of life as a call to greater moral and behavioral rectitude.

Instead, Neocologists pledged themselves to preserving the principles of nature \u2014 and the possibility of regrowth and renewal once the cycle of industrialism collapsed upon itself.

A corporate executive who finds she must deal with a business crisis and the debilitating illness of a child at home may be going through such a crucible.

The sigils are not mystic in and of themselves; rather, they are a shorthand description for demons that personify different sins and desires, codified by Goetic mages of long ago.

On the other hand, the Legacy\u2019s implications for psychotherapy interest Solomonists of the Free Council, who usually deal in Goetic demons with a distinctly modern cast.

Les Enfants consisted of one member from each of the four Atlantean orders.</div><div>Though the cabal found nothing more than titillating occultism and a bit of clumsy political poisoning among the Sleepers, Les Enfants did discover a trio of Scelesti who used \u201cBlack Masses\u201d as a cover for their own goals. Les Enfants are upheld as role models for young Clavicularius mages: unrelentingly virtuous, magnificently terrifying and goetically adept.</div><div>To this day, most Solomonists trace their lineage of initiation back to one of the four mages of Les Enfants.

In fact, quite a few of these young mages found their way to Awakening while trying to perform \u201cSatanic rituals\u201d out of some paperback purchased at a mall bookstore or cobbled together from movies and album lyrics. Not surprisingly, many of these young mages showed a tremendous interest in demons and demonology.</div><div>More than a few mentors found this interest ill-amusing, but they found a way to discourage rash inquiries into the infernal: the mentors sent their students for a year or two of training under the Clavicularius. The mentors knew full well the effect that Solomonist discipline would have on thrill-seeking young mages.</div><div>Most of these apprentices learned the intended lesson. Foolhardy young mages are more than willing to brave the threats of Hell itself, but they are less prepared to look into the face of their own greatest failings, weaknesses and traumas (or, to be honest, undertake the hard work required by this strenuously disciplined Legacy). However, some of these mages did stay and today form an important cohort in the Legacy\u2019s membership.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>Mages initiated into the Clavicularius must accept that they are flawed, broken, weak beings. Rather than taking this as an excuse for humility or despair, however, Solomonists consider weakness a challenge. The sacred  work of a Key-Bearer is not only to repair this faulty foundation, but to build a mighty edifice of the strengthened and Awakened soul upon it.</div><div>The practices of Goetia are incredibly hubris-ridden. Most Goeticists quickly descend into paranoia and self-loathing, faced as they are by their own failings on such a routine basis. A demon that embodies one\u2019s own innate cowardice is impossible to deceive with bluster, and the demon that gives form to the internal voice that whispers to a mage that he deserved the abuse he suffered from his parents cannot be ignored.</div><div>This is where the Clavicularius stand above other practitioners of Goetia. Key-Bearers are not content simply to face and acknowledge their failings. Instead, they try to hammer every weakness into a tool for their own use. A cowardly Goeticist claims that his fear is a valuable tool for ensuring survival; a Solomonist maintains that it is an opportunity to learn the true essence of valor, allowing her the chance to confront fear tangibly, over and again, until she masters it. That a bound and mastered demon of cowardice gives power over everyone else\u2019s latent timidity is a bonus.</div><div>People who encounter Clavicularius mages often find them arrogant and egotistical. The Key-Bearers say they are arrogant because they deserve to be. Who else confronts their own failings with such determination, throwing themselves against their weaknesses time and again, until they conquer them?</div><div>Or, until the Key-Bearers are conquered themselves. Many who initiate into this Legacy do not achieve its heights, and some even fall and plummet into the Abyss. As a result, Solomonists are regarded with no small concern by other mages, and rightly so.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Greater Rite of Castigation</h3><div>No one watches the Keepers of the Keys as closely as their own brethren. Nobody knows the potential for disaster better than those who face that threat constantly, and the Clavicularius are proud, but not stupid. They are utterly cognizant of the dangers of Goetia.</div><div>As a result, the Clavicularius evolved a form of checks and balances that would astound most mages for its invasiveness. The Greater Rite of Castigation is based on the oblation practiced by all Solomonists. However, rather than simply a ritual for re-establishing a sense of self, the Greater Rite is a literal summoning of the demons of a mage\u2019s psyche for other Solomonists to interrogate and punish. The subject of this rite is necessarily present when the demon is summoned and imprisoned within a warding. At that point, however, the mage is banished from the room, to allow those gathered to interrogate his personal demon.</div><div>The Greater Rite of Castigation is always led by an initiate of the third attainment, but other Clavicularii usually attend. These rites are not performed with any particular frequency; any elder of the Clavicularius may propose a Greater Rite for any member of the Legacy.</div><div>As might be imagined, the Greater Rite is a harrowing experience for a young mage. If his internal demons are found to be too strong or powerful, he is subject to the admonitions of his seniors, who will gather to discuss the problem with him and help him find ways to strengthen himself.</div><div>Though initiates of the Legacy are not required to follow such admonitions, they have ample reason to do so: mages who fail to acknowledge the findings of the interrogators and follow their advice risks being branded Scelesti by their fellow Clavicularius. If there is one thing a Consilium takes seriously, it is a charge of Nefandi from mages of this Legacy.</div><div>Despite the emotional risks (or perhaps because of them), most Clavicularius mages do not wait until their actions arouse concern in their elders. Instead, they approach their elders themselves to request the Greater Rite of Castigation, seeking the wisdom of their brethren in order to better ascertain and repair their own weaknesses.</div><div>Younger Clavicularius sometimes develop something of a thrill-seeker\u2019s attitude to the Greater Rite. They take pride in ferreting out their own failings, so that they can take steps to rectify them. Some among the latest generation of Solomonist mages have even taken to tattooing their bodies with the Solomonic sigil of the demon that most strongly embodies their Vice. Older Key-Bearers frown on such displays. They feel the tattoo smacks of defining one\u2019s self by one\u2019s weakness, rather than the conquering thereof, but such tattooing has not been forbidden.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Astral Plane</h3><div>The Clavicularius know that Goetic demons exist because those weaknesses exist within the mage himself, but the Astral Plane also holds many other entities. The Solomonists spend much time in exploring the Astral Plane, particularly the domain of Temenos, which they regard as most closely analogous to the collective soul of humanity. Astral journeys form the cornerstone pf the Legacy\u2019s practice. Indeed, all initiations within the Legacy happen upon the astral plane, within the Great Temple of Solomon.</div><div>The Great Temple of Solomon is not, of course, the actual temple of the legendary king. Rather, it is an astral construct created as a haven for Clavicularius gatherings. The four members of Les Enfants created the temple construct in the 17th century, as a place where the initiations of their apprentices might take place. It has stood since then, bolstered by Clavicularius masters.</div><div>The Temple itself is a sprawling edifice of gleaming white marble. Ten feet off the ground, along every wall, runs a foot-wide strip of gold etched with the various seals and pentacles of the Keys of Solomon. Many young Clavicularius learn the sigils\u2019 meanings here.</div><div>These halls are far from bustling, however. At most times, only a mage and his mentor are visiting. Occasionally, a pair might see another figure gliding along some far-off corridor, going about her business. Large gatherings of Goeticists rarely happen, for they are driven by their own sense of right and wrong, and attend to their own goals. Initiations of a new member form a notable exception: tutors put out the word about a new Key-Bearer, and their acquaintances in the Legacy visit the Temple to size up the new recruit.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Regal Self</h3><div>A central tenet of the Clavicularius is that of \u201cthe Regal Self.\u201d During Solomonists\u2019 initiation into the order, they perceive themselves seated upon a throne, watching themselves pay fealty, and kneeling before a throne, kowtowing to themselves. This marks the first step toward forging the mage into a Clavicularius. The experience remains with a Key-Bearer throughout her life.</div><div>In this fashion, the Legacy hammers home its ideal: the base, unworthy parts of the self must submit to those numinous, virtuous essences of the self. Throughout the rest of the apprentices\u2019 training, Clavicularius mentors question their apprentices about their actions and ask, \u201cWas that worthy of the person upon the throne or the person groveling before it?\u201d</div><div>Clavicularii seek always to measure themselves by this standard. Any member who ceases to do so has begun to fall into the Abyss. To be sure, the tenets of humility that many magicians prize as necessary for enlightenment do tend to be rare among the Clavicularius, who see themselves as righteous sorcerer-kings. They are regal and benevolent in all things \u2013 or at least, they attempt to be.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Induction</h3><div>The Clavicularius do not share their Mysteries with just any one. Though they are often willing to teach the techniques of Goetia to mages they know and trust, not every Goeticist will be permitted to join the ranks of the Clavicularius. In fact, very few are welcome among the Keepers of the Keys without close examination and training.</div><div>A Goeticist who wants to learn the techniques of the Clavicularius must demonstrate her facility in at least the basics of Goetic practice. More than that, she needs a reputation as someone who struggles to achieve virtue. (The tendency of mages to watch potential apprentices to determine their Wisdom certainly applies here.)</div><div>An apprentice who meets a mentor\u2019s strict standards will be welcomed into the fold. The first initiation into the rites of the Clavicularius is a harrowing experience that requires the ingestion of a powerful hallucinogen. The mentor shapes these hallucinations, using the Mind Arcanum to craft images of deeper and deeper terror and suffering. All the while, the apprentice answers questions designed to test her knowledge of Goetia, and trick her into revealing less-than-virtuous reasons for its pursuit.</div><div>The ordeal culminates in a journey to the Astral realms, to the Great Temple of Solomon in the Temenos. Once there, the apprentice finds herself at the foot of a great golden throne, sublime in its geometry and shape. A strange experience then occurs, unique to the experience of forging one\u2019s soul into the first attainment of this Legacy. The student is simultaneously seated upon the throne and forced to kneel at the base of the throne, bowing and swearing fealty to herself.</div><div>Each initiation further into the Mysteries of the Legacy begins with a Greater Rite of Castigation, allowing senior Key-Bearers to judge the member\u2019s self-mastery before initiation. The soulcrafting of the Clavicularius is directed towards a specific end \u2014 the utter mastery of the mage\u2019s weaknesses and sins.</div>",magic:"<h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Magic of the Clavicularius</h2><div>Standard Goetic magic is explained on pp. 323\u2013326 of Mage: The Awakening. The Key-Bearers developed a variety of other rotes and spells within their Legacy, which they teach only to initiates.</div><div>At Mind 4, Clavicularius mages learn to aid others in confronting their flaws of spirit, casting the \u201cGoetic Struggle\u201d upon another person. Some Key-Bearers use the techniques of religious castigation or psychotherapy to help a subject bulwark herself against her personified sin. Conversely, the mage can project her own defeated Goetic demon on to another person and tell it to work its temptation.</div><div style='margin: 10px 0;'><div><b>Clavicularius Rote: Solomonic Authority</b></div><div><b>Dice Pool:</b> Presence + Intimidation + Mind</div><div>This rote, based on the spell \u201cGoetic Struggle\u201d (see p. 324, Mage: The Awakening) is considered an essential practice, and is named after a precept of the Clavicularius and some Silver Ladder mages: to rule another, one must rule oneself first.</div></div><div style='margin: 10px 0;'><div><b>Clavicularius Rote: Egregore of Sin</b></div><div><b>Dice Pool:</b> Presence + Occult + Spirit</div><div>This rote, based on the spell \u201cGoetic Evocation,\u201d is not recklessly taught. Using the appropriate Keys of Solomon, the Clavicularius grants his deepest sins a spiritual form, calling upon a manifestation of his inner demons through an intense summoning rite.</div></div><h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Evil Means, Good Ends</h3><div>The Clavicularius find several uses for their bound and defeated inner demons. One of the simplest is to destroy a wicked person through sin. For instance, a Key-Bearer might kill a drug dealer by possessing him with a demon that makes him crave his own product, leading to a fatal overdose. A cunning but crooked politician\u2019s career could be wrecked by sending a lust-demon to lead him into \u201cbimbo eruptions\u201d (the demon can even become the bimbo, if the Clavicularius knows the Spirit Arcanum well enough).</div><div>Solomonists can also use Goetic demons to counter possession by other sorts of demons. The mage binds her inner demon through \u201cGoetic Struggle,\u201d then sends it (by Mind 4) into a possessed person\u2019s mind with a command to fight the other demon. A brave Clavicularius (and there\u2019s no other kind) can even project her own consciousness into the possessed person\u2019s mind (via Mind 4 \u201cDream Traveler\u201d) to join the fight.</div><div>Any use of Goetic demons can very easily become an act of Hubris. If a mage has \u201cjust cause,\u201d however, and there\u2019s really no less invasive way to stop an evildoer\u2019s activities, the Storyteller can waive the degeneration roll \u2014 or at least grant a bonus die, since the character used her inner demons for a righteous cause.</div>",attainmentsDescrizione:"<div>The attainments of the Clavicularius serve one goal \u2014 to make the Solomonist aware of the flaws in his soul, allowing him to isolate them and wall himself off from them, turning them into something almost outside of himself. The Clavicularius are then capable of using these flaws of character as weapons against others.</div><div>Additionally, such self-knowledge creates a mage who can better imprison those impulses, using her experience at restraining her Vice to keep her other sins in check.</div><div>Finally, this Legacy aims to grant absolute mastery over the Goetic demon that reflects one of the mage\u2019s soul-deep sins.

Because of this, the Clavicularius can sense those taints within others, and project them onto others.</div><div>By inflaming his sin and projecting it onto another, the Clavicularius creates an impetus to behave in a similar fashion in his target. This acts like the Mind 2 \u201cEmotional Urging\u201d spell, including the ability for the Awakened to sense they are being manipulated. However, if the target already possesses the Vice projected by the Clavicularius, she is immune to this attainment \u2013 a soul that already battles its own internal sin is immune to that same sin from an outside source.</div><div>Clavicularius mentors warn their initiates about using this attainment frivolously, for driving others to acts of sin can be an act of Hubris.</div>",firstAttainmentOptArcana:"",firstAttainmentOptDescrizione:"",secondAttainmentName:"Goetic Bulwark",secondAttainmentPrerequisites:"Gnosis 5, Mind 3",secondAttainmentDescription:"<div>This attainment is a perfecting of the techniques studied in the \u201cGoetic Struggle\u201d spell.

Some recoil in horror from its faintly totalitarian undertones.

Atlantis will rise again \u2014 literally \u2014 when the human race achieves its next stage of evolution in the Advent\u2019s esoteric account of human history. The Daksha believe human evolution follows a cycle of seven stages. During the third stage of the current cycle, however, humanity\u2019s precursors fell from a state of grace. To continue the cycle properly and resume the evolutionary journey to Cosmic Oneness, humanity must reverse the wrong turnings of past ages. </div><div>Long before Atlantis, the Daksha say, a greater race than humanity lived on the continent of Lemuria. These superior precursors were perfect androgynes unfettered by our own flawed duality of gender. The hermaphroditic Lemurians also possessed a third eye in the back of their heads, with which they saw the Akashic Record of Supernal Truth.</div><div>The Daksha use a process called Daksha-Yoga to transform themselves into Lemurians. As each Daksha gains mastery of Daksha-Yoga, she develops a third eye on the back of her head before achieving perfect androgyny.

The Dhyanis say the Masters are magically aware former inhabitants of Atlantis. Most of the Daksha believe the Masters are Oracles.</div><div>Daksha-Yoga demands that the Legacy\u2019s adherents learn enough Atlantean lore to recreate the lost land\u2019s civilization. To this end, the Daksha study every trace of Atlantis they can find and work tirelessly to reclaim its lost magic. They contribute some of the Mysterium\u2019s most expert mystic archaeologists. Time is short: Atlantis will soon rise, the Dhyanis say, and the Awakened need to prepare for their destiny as renewed masters of the world. And the Daksha make sure everyone else knows they are ready to take up their duty.</div>",alternateNickname:"The Advent",orders:"<div>From their beginning, the Daksha associated with the Mysterium. The vast majority of Daksha still come from that order, or join it. The Legacy\u2019s founders were all Obrimos, but Daksha tutors will train mages of other paths if they belong to the Mysterium. The order holds the Daksha in high regard, though it\u2019s widely known the Daksha make their own studies before they tell other Mysterium members about the best lore and artifacts they find. As long as the Mysterium gets to see the goods eventually, its leaders grant the Daksha their private collection. Still, the Daksha gain more from the Mysterium than the Mysterium gains from the Daksha.</div><div>A few Daksha who research the warfare of Atlantis join the Adamantine Arrow. These mages tend to be better at the theory of conflict than at actual fighting. The Silver Ladder attracts other Daksha who try to convince the order to follow their vision of a new world ruled by the Awakened. The Daksha, as masters of self-publicity, don\u2019t often see much use for the Guardians of the Veil, but some Advent decide the best way to learn secrets is to become one of the keepers.</div><div>Very few Daksha see any reason to join the Free Council. The leaders of the Free Council are in no hurry to invite the Advent, Atlantean literalists all, into their order. Daksha are certainly not banned from the Free Council, but any Advent would need a very good personal reason to join, and some assurance that he would get some benefit from the association. </div>",appearance:"The Daksha look like what they are: the practitioners of an ascetic lifestyle devoted to physical perfection.

The Legacy\u2019s founder thought ethnic origin reflected evolutionary potential (although many Daksha prefer not to think about it). Officially, the Legacy no longer says that only mages of Caucasian or Indian descent can join the Coming Race. In the last few decades, individual Daksha have trained members of other ethnic groups. Unofficially, Daksha of other races suffer abuse and disdain from Advent who hold more \u201ctraditional\u201d (racist) views, and the Dhyanis have done nothing to prevent it.",organizzation:"<div>The Daksha observe a strict hierarchy. A student always defers to her tutor. The tutor, in turn, defers to a cabal of Daksha responsible for the Legacy\u2019s activities in his section of the world. Regional divisions cover South and East Asia, the Middle East and Africa, Europe (including all of Russia), the Americas and a new division for Australia and Oceania. The regional cabals take their orders from the central Daksha cabal in Chennai (formerly called Madras), which oversees the Legacy\u2019s activities in India directly. The Chennai cabal answers to the Dhyanis, who transmit their instructions from their undisclosed sanctum. Seats in the ruling cabals are for life. The Dhyanis select the members of the Chennai cabal, who in turn appoint the regional cabals.</div><div>Notwithstanding this organization, the Daksha find themselves deeply divided. Factions within the Advent often work against each other. Apart from regional competition, their main dispute comes from humanity\u2019s fate when the Kali Yuga ends and Atlantis rises. Some Daksha would just ignore the un-evolved humans when the New World begins, and leave them behind on the old lands. Other Daksha seek a means to evolve everyone to the Daksha\u2019s level. Most Advent expect a more Darwinian outcome, in which the un-evolved gradually die out. A few Advent don\u2019t want to wait. When Kali Yuga ends, these few intend to wipe the un-evolved from the face of the planet.</div><div>Each Dhyani adopts the name of an Atlantean deity, as given in the Stanzas of Dzyan, the central text of Daksha-Yoga. They are: Akhantaram, Daksha Takharam, Khetaram, Khiet-Shirani, Varuna, Prithivi, Yayuram and Agni Daksha. Khetaram suggests the possibility of evolving the rest of humanity.

Eisler became fascinated with various esoteric groups that grew from Western interpretations of Hinduism. Eisler\u2019s enthusiasm eventually took him to India. When Eisler returned in 1891, he possessed a third eye on the back of his head, and was no longer only a \u201che.\u201d This new Eisler adopted the shadow name of Daksha Takharam, and claimed he had found the legendary realm of Shambhalla. There, he met with a spiritually advanced being called Kuut Humi. This entity vouchsafed to him a complete text of the ancient Stanzas of Dzyan. In the Stanzas, the young mage found a prophecy of the second rising of Atlantis. Kuut Humi told Eisler that he could shape the evolutionary destiny of the human race, and instructed the mage in the principles of Daksha-Yoga.</div><div>Daksha Takharam later explained that Daksha-Yoga was created by an Atlantean archmage named Daksha. This archmage transformed himself/herself into the synthesis of all previous stages of human evolution. Since human evolution is cyclical, Daksha also anticipated every subsequent evolutionary stage. Through a year and a day of Daksha\u2019s meditations, Eisler developed a third eye and became an androgyne.</div><div>Daksha Takharam gathered seven disciples, all German, British or American members of the Mysterium. The eight of them returned to India, where they founded an ashram in Madras. Under Daksha Takharam\u2019s direction, each disciple contacted another Atlantean Master. Within 10 years, these eight began to take on pupils of their own. Later, the Dhyanis sent their pupils into the West to recover Atlantean lore and artifacts, and to make new Awakened converts.</div><div>The Daksha grew slowly but steadily. Most recruits came from the Mysterium. At the end of World War I, the Daksha Dhyanis left Madras for parts unknown. They claimed that the Great War had caused a psychic storm of such intensity that they needed constant seclusion for meditations to quell the emanations. For all intents and purposes, they vanished. From then on, the Dhyanis communicated with their pupils through scrying windows, dreams and astral projections. Occasionally, a Dhyan would turn up unexpectedly in Madras, ostensibly to check up on his/her pupils; these visits became more infrequent over the years. The last time any Daksha met a Dhyan in person was in 1938. Still, the Legacy enjoyed considerable prestige through its claim to be led by actual archmasters.</div><div>During World War II, the Dhyanis supported the Nazis, who held somewhat similar theories about racial superiority and human evolution. The Dhyanis said that the Nazi eugenic experiment would improve human stock in preparation for the Coming Race. After the war, however, almost no Daksha would admit their Legacy had ever approved of the Nazis in any way. (But then, they had a lot of company among Sleepers. Plenty of intellectuals supported eugenics right up to the liberation of the death camps.) Daksha recruitment dropped off sharply after World War II and only recovered during the late \u201960s, as the New Age movement took off.</div><div>The Legacy\u2019s poor choice in friends wasn\u2019t the only blow to Daksha prestige. The reliability of the Dhyanis and the Masters is also increasingly in doubt, even among the Legacy\u2019s younger members.</div><div>In 1903, the Masters predicted that Atlantis would rise in 1946. The Dhyanis also relayed predictions that Atlantis would return in 1967, 1980 and 1999. No one\u2019s seen any lost continents reappear lately. Seemingly unconcerned, each time, the Dhyanis have simply issued another target date. (This time, they say Atlantis will rise on December 21, 2012).</div><div>A growing number of Daksha wonder if the Masters and the Dhyanis really know what they are doing. The Dhyanis still send messages from their place of seclusion, but no one has seen a Dhyan face-to-face for more than 60 years. If Daksha Takharam is still alive, he/she must be over 130 years old \u2014 possible for a master of Life magic, but not a sure thing, either. Where are Daksha Takharam and his/her disciples? Are they even still alive?</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Masters</h3></div><div>Are the Masters really Oracles? If not, who are they? The Dhyanis keep their silence when asked. Perhaps they don\u2019t know the truth themselves.</div><div>Each Dhyan has his/her own Master who communicates exclusively with him/her. If the all Dhyanis are honest, apparently the Masters are not of one mind (for example, on the question of how the evolution of humanity should progress, which is hardly insignificant). They\u2019re not all that reliable, either, having falsely predicted the rising of Atlantis four times so far. One would think that Oracles could do better. So, who are they? Some Daksha have suspicions they prefer not to voice, for fear of expulsion from the Legacy. Still, nothing stops them thinking (at the moment), and the Legacy includes many skilled investigators. Whether the Daksha\u2019s leaders will allow the truth to come out is another question.</div><div>Some members of the Mysterium rather unkindly suggest that the Masters may be demons or spirits attempting to control a group of mages for their own purposes. Maybe the recovery of Atlantean artifacts serves some infernal agenda. Maybe the \u201csecret masters\u201d want just one particular artifact recovered, after which point they\u2019ll cut the Daksha loose. Maybe the Masters are just doing it for laughs. But if the Dhyanis are archmages, wouldn\u2019t they see through a demon\u2019s deceptions?</div><div>If the Masters are not spirits or ascended Atlanteans, what else could they be? Ancient vampires using telepathic powers? Mad gods? Aliens? None of these really seem probable, but again, colleagues of the Daksha within the Mysterium sometimes make the suggestions.</div><div>The Exarchs are possible candidates. This theory, first suggested by a disenchanted Daksha some 20 years ago, suggests that the Legacy is all a plot to divide the Awakened and precipitate a war between them, with the Daksha as a catalyst. But, surely, the Exarchs are more subtle than to use a group of three-eyed hermaphrodites as their pawns?</div><div>Perhaps the Daksha\u2019s leaders are right, and the Masters really are Oracles. But that raises a more disturbing question: are the Oracles fallible?</div><div>Some Daksha nurse doubts that the Masters exist at all. Maybe the Dhyanis are deluded, they say, or just making the Masters up. If the Dhyanis were making the Masters up, though, wouldn\u2019t the archmages try to tell a more consistent story? Anyway, no one\u2019s seen a Dhyan face-to-face in decades. What if the problem isn\u2019t the Masters? What if the Dhyanis are no longer whoever they say they are?</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>The Daksha believe they know how to recover Atlantis. Their leaders hold the answers. Their founders commune with Oracles. The Daksha possess the key to bring back Atlantis and the rule of the Awakened. And, of course, the Daksha are one step more evolved than everyone else. Their colleagues in the Mysterium think Advent mages are arrogant and condescending, but, at the same time, the Mysterium members respect the sheer volume of knowledge the Daksha have uncovered. Members of other orders who meet the Daksha often feel the same way, to a greater or lesser degree.</div><div>Despite the Advent hierarchical structure, individual Daksha are usually left free to pursue their own agendas. After the amount of training (and indoctrination) they\u2019ve been through, their leaders trust that members will serve the Legacy\u2019s agenda in one way or another \u2014 and most do.</div><div>All Daksha must answer to their regional cabals, but, most of the time, they can choose their own activities. Every Daksha is expected to follow the pronouncements of the Dhyanis and the Masters \u2014 but the Dhyanis\u2019 words are vague and inconsistent enough that Daksha can usually concoct an interpretation that justifies whatever they want to do anyway.</div><div>The lack of real oversight by the Dhyanis often leads to disagreements among their followers. Rival factions of Daksha may wage little wars against each other as they compete for caches of Atlantean magic. Daksha whose quest for Atlantean lore bear fruit are more likely to gain status and the favor of their superiors.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Manners</h3><div>Daksha often find they must work with mages inferior to themselves \u2014 namely, everyone who isn\u2019t part of the Advent. Like many people who base their lives on spiritual certainties, Daksha often can\u2019t understand why anyone wouldn\u2019t want to be like them; refusal to join the Advent suggests ignorance at best, a failure of intelligence or morals at worst.</div><div>Most Daksha are sensible enough to know they have to work with other people. The Daksha may think those who are not willing to evolve are destined for the dustbin of history; but, just as an evangelical Christian who secretly believes his friends are destined for Hell, the Daksha are smart enough to know when not to preach. They practice a kind of selective blindness. For the sake of their relationships, they act as if their non-Daksha friends are Daksha, too. Maybe if the Daksha set a good example, their friends will see the light and join the Advent.</div><div>Of course, some mages aren\u2019t friends. The Daksha still try to meet insults and accusations with good manners. The doctrines of Daksha-Yoga say that outward serenity reflects inward grace. Daksha can be condescending, arrogant or hostile, but even when they\u2019re informing other mages of their inferiority, dismissing their colleagues\u2019 opinions or dispensing threats, the Daksha are always unfailingly nice. They keep strange, serene smiles on their faces and never raise their voices. Daksha never use obscenity, foul language or rude names. They say \u201cplease\u201d and \u201cthank you.\u201d As a result, they get away with acts that would bring censure on less diplomatic mages. Quite often, people might hear what a Daksha says but fail to grasp its import, because how can someone so polite be planning to kill most of humanity? Including you?</div><div>Sometimes, opponents of the Advent underestimate them as shallow lotus-eaters, crackpots too blissed-out to pose a threat. On the other hand, mages can just as easily overestimate the Daksha\u2019s skills: they look like they know more and wield greater powers than they really do.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Stanzas of Dzyan</h3><div>Most of the Daksha\u2019s doctrines come from a small book of blank verse called the Stanzas of Dzyan. Helena Petrovna Blavatsky, founder of the Theosophical Society, claimed she channeled the text and published fragments in The Secret Doctrine, with a great deal of her own commentary. Sleeper scholars say Blavatsky cribbed her Stanza excerpts from the Rig-Veda and other Hindu scriptures, filtered through her own magpie occultism and imagination. That didn\u2019t stop hundreds of thousands of Sleepers from joining the Theosophical Society, the religion Blavatsky created to institutionalize her doctrine. The Mysterium studied The Secret Doctrine immediately after its publication. They assured other mages that Madame Blavatsky didn\u2019t have a clue about the Mysteries and there was never any such book as the Stanzas of Dzyan.</div><div>Fifteen years later, Daksha Takharam revealed his/her version of the Stanzas. The Daksha\u2019s book generally follows Blavatsky\u2019s mythology, but is more complete than her fragments and somewhat less opaque. Everything the Daksha believe about human prehistory is spelled out in High Speech. Each copy is traditionally written on a number of palm leaves in golden ink. Daksha tutors require their pupils to scribe their own copies of the Stanzas before they complete the first attainment of Daksha-Yoga.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Seven Root Races</h3><div>According to the Stanzas of Dzyan, the human race is locked into an evolutionary cycle. Humanity did not evolve from lower primates. Rather, the Cosmic One emanated creatures destined to evolve through seven Root Races before returning to the Cosmic One and beginning again. Furthermore, each Root Race has seven sub-races that evolve, one from the other, but which can co-exist and inter-breed for a time.</div><div>This cycle has happened before and will happen again. This time around, however, the cycle has gone wrong, with the sinking of Atlantis as just one consequence. In the Daksha\u2019s version of Theosophical history, the seven races have been, are and (if the cycle is repaired) will be the following:</div><div><b>The First Root Race:</b> Astral beings made of pure energy. These \u201cChildren of the Fire Mist\u201d condensed as their subraces progressed, until they evolved into...</div><div><b>The Second Root Race:</b> Huge amorphous beings, souls without consciousnesses. In each subsequent sub-race, these beings shrank and developed limbs and bodily definition, to become...</div><div><b>The Third Root Race:</b> The hermaphrodite, three-eyed, otherwise human inhabitants of Atlantis\u2019 precursor, Lemuria. At first, the Lemurians lived in a state of innocence and grace, guided by Supernal wisdom received through the third eye. The second sub-race of the Lemurians fell when, in an attempt to pre-empt evolution, they gained Arcane knowledge before they were destined to do so. An evolutionary cataclysm happened. The Lemurians split into genders ahead of their evolutionary schedule. Eventually, the Lemurians became...</div><div><b>The Fourth Root Race:</b> This race began as the gigantic, blue-skinned Rmoahals who later became the Atlanteans, the fulcrum of the human evolutionary cycle. The Atlanteans built the Watchtowers and codified magic. They learned how to use Mana (or as they called it, \u201cVril\u201d ) as a power source for advanced magical technologies and terrible weapons. They were still crippled, incomplete beings, however. Their own pride ended the Atlantean dream, forcing an exodus and sending the Watchtowers beyond the physical world. The exiles evolved into...</div><div><b>The Fifth Root Race:</b> True humanity as we know it. In their commentaries on the Stanzas, the Dhyanis divide humanity into separate sub-races, some evolutionarily superior to others. Officially, the Aryans (that is, Caucasians and people of northern India) are the latest evolutionary stage. By Daksha reckoning, they are the sixth sub-race of the Fifth Root, and hence the only candidates for further evolution. In the developed West, most Daksha are uncomfortable with the racist aspect of their philosophy. However, a significant \u2014 and powerful \u2014 minority believe in the racism and use it to justify their attitude towards \u201clesser\u201d humans.</div><div>The Daksha say that by using magic to recover androgyny and the third eye, they can steer the evolutionary cycle back to its original course. When the world holds enough re-evolved humans, Atlantis will rise from the ocean. The remnants of the lesser human races will be made obsolete. The new Atlanteans will evolve into the seventh sub-race, who will all be Awakened. Their third eyes will see into the Supernal World, and the breach in the cycle caused by the Atlanteans\u2019 arrogance will be repaired. Then the cycle can continue, with the appearance of...</div><div><b>The Sixth Root Race:</b> Beings so attuned with the Supernal World that they will begin to fade from the material realm. Eventually, they will lose even the semblance of human form, becoming...</div><div><b>The Seventh Root Race:</b> Entirely astral beings who will grow so in touch with the Supernal Realm that individual identity and thought will become unnecessary. When the last trace of human individuality has faded into Oneness and has been absorbed into the Supernal Realm, the cycle will begin again.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Atlantean Artifacts</h3><div>The Daksha seem to have great success in unearthing relics of Atlantis, including artifacts they say came from Lemuria. (Most mages don\u2019t believe Lemuria ever existed. The Daksha reply that most Sleepers don\u2019t believe Atlantis ever existed.) The Legacy\u2019s archeologists hunt such relics at an increasingly frantic rate \u2014 and find them. Daksha leaders say this is a sign that Atlantis is ready to rise. More cynical Mysterium mages suggested it\u2019s a sign that the Daksha have hired some reliable artisans: the craftsmen of Egypt, Southeast Asia and Central America are notoriously skilled forgers of antiquities. Most of the ancient objects the Daksha hand over to the Mysterium are only of cultural interest \u2014 potsherds and coins, fragmentary tablets and tableware, brooches, buttons, hairslides and combs. They may bear sigils in High Speech but have no magical properties.</div><div>Every so often, someone uncovers an object of true value: a document carved on stone or metal tablets, an Imbued item or even a true Artifact. Many Daksha will resort to anything to get their hands on such items. Most of these Atlantean items require an infusion of Mana to work. A newly discovered magical treasure might retain one or two points of Mana in its reservoir, but most have none and need to be charged.</div><div>The Daksha have found a few fragments of what they believe are Atlantean flying machines. They have yet to find their Holy Grail, a complete working Vimana \u2014 a flying machine armed with weapons the like of which the world has tried to forget for 5,000 years. Likewise, no one has found a Brahmastra, reputedly the ultimate weapon of the heroes of Atlantis. If anyone were to find either of these weapons, the various factions of the Daksha would begin a desperate race to seize them. What happens next depends on the faction who gets the item. Some Daksha would destroy an Atlantean superweapon as a leftover from the pride that destroyed Atlantis and broke the cosmos. Some Daksha would hide the weapon and study it. Others would freely use it as part of their great plan to clear the Earth of un-evolved humanity, in line with prophecy from the Stanzas of Dzyan.</div><div style='margin: 15px;'><h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Atlantean Fire Crystal (Imbued Item \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022)</h3><p>Durability 3, Size 1, Structure 4</p><p>Mana Capacity: 11</p><p>During the last 10 years, the Daksha have found several Atlantean Fire Crystals. The Daksha believe the Atlanteans used these reddish, fist-sized crystals as a power source for other magical devices or perhaps even to supply light and heat for Atlantean homes.</p><p>When energized, the crystal duplicates the Prime 3 spell \u201cLey Lines.\u201d Some crystals are imbued with other magic powers; other crystals are found with stands or cases, inscribed in High Speech.</p></div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction </h2><div>In the Western world, most Daksha are fervent evangelists. While the prospect of becoming a three-eyed hermaphrodite might not appeal to most mages, the Advent offers several benefits.</div><div>The Daksha give the impression that they know awesome, mighty secrets. Never mind that they harp on every advantage they can, make copies of their scripture for every single member of the Legacy and loan them out to any mage who expresses an interest. It doesn\u2019t matter: a Daksha only has to hint that he/she could say much more if he/she wanted. The sheer detail and extravagance of Daksha mythology lends it verisimilitude. How can a Daksha be wrong, when he/she can rattle off the names of Atlantean cities and kings and describe daily life in Lemuria? And the Legacy does show great skill at finding Atlantean relics.</div><div>The Daksha future, too, holds an ominous glamour. Join us, they say. Rule with us in a paradise where your power will be absolute. Hold the key to magics you cannot dream of! Become a superman, greater even than other mages! The reality might be a little different \u2014 or non-existent \u2014 but, despite the dubious status of their leaders, the Daksha seem so sure of their destiny. Their sheer confidence can attract mages \u2014 especially the forceful Obrimos \u2014 in a World of Darkness where so little is certain.</div><div>Finally, there\u2019s the sex. The Daksha are beautiful. They\u2019ll tell you that they know how to do things with their bodies that humans simply can\u2019t. The Daksha are beyond male and female, gay and straight, and they are taught to use their bodies to their greatest potential. They say they can experience heights of ecstasy that the single-gendered literally can\u2019t imagine. This tactic pulled in a lot of converts back in the \u201960s, and still meets with a fair degree of success, especially in Western Europe. In the end, the promises of wild hermaphrodite sex can\u2019t be the only reason a convert joins (especially when the new apprentice learns he actually must remain celibate until he achieves true androgyny) \u2014 but the promise of great sex gets other mages listening, and that\u2019s a start.</div><div>When a Daksha finds a willing convert, the Daksha takes the prospective apprentice to the Advent\u2019s tutor, and asks the tutor to take the other mage as a pupil. While Daksha tutors rarely turn down a mage who meets the Legacy\u2019s requirements, Daksha-Yoga takes a long time to learn. The apprentice must adopt a strict vegan diet, take vows of chastity and poverty and follow the Legacy\u2019s meditative exercises for hours each day. When the recruit learns enough of the basic principles, she shaves her head and retreats to a cell. There, under the instruction of the tutor, she adopts a meditation position and enters a trance. The meditation lasts three days straight, with no food or water, while the recruit crafts her soul according to the guidelines in the Stanzas of Dzyan, with her tutor\u2019s help. Students often gather at a regional cabal\u2019s ashram and undergo their initiations at the same time.</div><div>During the early days of the Legacy, one Daksha initiate in four died of starvation without ever waking up. These days, Daksha tutors are more soft-hearted (and more reluctant to lose Willpower for nothing). Most tutors stop the rite if they think prospective apprentices will fail and die. If the initiate succeeds, he wakes from her trance with a third eye in the back of her head.</div><div>The second attainment requires long practice at breath and body control, and a similar ordeal. When the tutor thinks the apprentice is ready, the junior Daksha again shaves her head and retreats to a cell. The tutor puts her in a trance and watches over her as the pupil\u2019s body undergoes further changes. This time, the trance lasts a week. The Daksha becomes double-gendered. The vow of chastity lapses; otherwise, all the rules of Daksha-Yoga remain in force. The Daksha isn\u2019t halfway between both genders or sexless. He/she becomes wholly male and wholly female at the same time. His/her personality changes to reflect his/her new state. The Daksha is in perfect harmony. He/she feels fantastic, better than he/she ever did before. He/she quite reasonably thinks that other mages should want to feel like this, and starts spreading the word if he/she didn\u2019t before.</div><div>The third attainment requires a deeper trance than any before and a profound physiological shock. This might involve hanging suspended by hooks through the Daksha\u2019s skin, piercing his/her flesh with knives and skewers or some similar mortification of the flesh. Again, the tutor places the pupil into a trance; this time, the Daksha refines his/her body to such a level that he/she becomes truly superhuman.</div><div>All the while that the Daksha gather the experience and skill necessary to undergo each initiation, they are expected to practice the necessary disciplines of body and spirit needed to prepare for the next stage: meditation, yogic exercise and, during the later stages, Tantric practices and ordeals of pain.</div><div style='margin: 15px\u2019><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;\u2019>Initiation Mechanics </h3> <div>When a mage undergoes the Daksha initiation, her player must roll Stamina + Resolve. If the roll succeeds, the character becomes a Daksha with the suitable attainment. If the roll fails, the tutor steps in and stops the rite. The character can try again after more training, when the tutor thinks the character is ready, which could be a few weeks or a whole year.</div><div>The Storyteller can, if she wants, simply rule that the mage survives \u2014 and someone else who goes through the ordeal at the same time doesn\u2019t.</div></div><h3 style='margin-bottom: 0';>Bacchajudagaras</h3><div>The ruling cabal of the Daksha still controls the Legacy from Chennai, and India still boasts the greatest number of Daksha. India has one-sixth of the world\u2019s population, mostly Hindu, and a cultural framework that legitimates magic, altered states of consciousness and the notion of a transcendent reality beyond the physical world: India produces a lot of mages.</div><div>Some of India\u2019s mages Awaken very young. The Daksha see these bacchajudagaras (\u201cchild-mages\u201d) as a crucial part of their order. Daksha proselytes do their utmost to bring as many child-mages as they can into the Advent. The children\u2019s parents, dazzled by promises of their children\u2019s glorious future, readily give their offspring to the Advent. If religious persuasion doesn\u2019t work, money usually sways poorer families. When all else fails, the Daksha fall back on kidnapping. The Daksha don\u2019t care about a child-mage\u2019s Path, an exception to their usual restriction to fellow Obrimos or Mysterium.</div><div>The Daksha keep their bacchajudagaras at the Chennai ashram, where tutors drill them in the disciplines of Daksha-Yoga all day, every day. The tutors constantly remind their charges that they\u2019re special, but allow them no rest, no holidays and no childhood. The bacchajudagaras\u2019 years of intense studies sometimes bring the more talented among them as far as the second attainment of Daksha-Yoga before they reach 20 years of age. They are all promising mages, but the Legacy also turns most of them into frustrated, damaged individuals who know nothing about ordinary, human life. Some bacchajudagaras envy Sleepers for their thoughtless lives; other bacchajudagaras hate Sleepers. </div>",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"The harsh discipline of Daksha-Yoga demands complete commitment from its practitioners.

Through the rigors of training, she also begins to refine her body. Her skin becomes smoother, muscles become stronger and more supple, and body hair, but not head hair, begins to thin and fade away. The mage becomes able to access the benefits of the Life 2 spell \u201cBody Control\u201d at any time.<div>The third eye has the potential for great things. At this stage, however, the Daksha can merely use the third eye as an extra eye. When the eye is open and uncovered, she can see in every direction, front and back, with an effect similar to the Space 1 spell \u201cOmnivision.\u201d When closed, the perfectly round eye is still fairly obvious. Many Daksha grow their hair long to cover the eye, or wear hats, scarves or turbans. All spells involving sight perception (such as all the versions of Mage Sight) work just as well out of the third eye as they do from the normal two.</div>",firstAttainmentOptArcana:"",firstAttainmentOptDescrizione:"",secondAttainmentName:"The Androgyne Condition",secondAttainmentPrerequisites:"Gnosis 5, Life 3",secondAttainmentDescription:"<div>A Daksha awakens from the second initiatory trance as a hermaphrodite, gaining the primary sexual characteristics of both genders. A male Daksha becomes shorter and slimmer, with a higher voice and a more delicate neck and jaw line. His Adam\u2019s apple shrinks, and he gains small breasts. His genitalia move slightly, and he gains a vagina and womb underneath his testes. A female Daksha experiences analogous but opposite changes.</div><div>With some concentration, the Daksha can temporarily become either sex more completely, with an effect similar to the Life 3 spell, \u201cTransform Self.\u201d This is sometimes useful in that all three forms the Daksha can take \u2014 male, female and hermaphrodite \u2014 look distinctly different. The gendered forms don\u2019t just look like the other forms in drag. A casual observer, particularly a Sleeper, might notice the resemblance between a Daksha\u2019s male form, female form and hermaphrodite form (perhaps thinking, \u201cHey, she could be the sister of that guy I met this morning\u201d) \u2014 but few people would immediately think the three forms are the same person.</div><div>(The Storyteller might call for a Wits + Composure roll for a character to notice the similarity between forms, but only an exceptional success would let someone suspect that two forms are the same person \u2014 and a Sleeper probably Disbelieves at once.

The offspring lack the third eye, though; they are at a transitional stage between human and the Coming Race. Hermaphrodite children born in Western hospitals are normally assigned genders as a matter of routine practice, with surgery to enforce the decision.

All too often, mages see the Acanthus as fitting into that same mold \u2014 mercurial, but ultimately harmless and good-hearted. The Daoine remember the truths behind those stories, when princes weren\u2019t charmers but blood-soaked warriors and when wicked queens danced in red-hot iron boots until they died. Justice is the Daoine\u2019s calling; through their mastery of the Fate Arcanum, they offer vengeance to the wronged and justice to those the world seems to pass by. The Daoine are the deus ex machina at the end of the faerie tale, the twist of fate that ensures that the wicked stepsisters\u2019 eyes are plucked out by white doves and the woodsman\u2019s axe is freshly sharpened when he goes to check on the ruckus at grandma\u2019s house.</div><div>The Daoine (pronounced DEE-nee or THEE-na) are usually less frivolous and impulsive than their brethren on the Path of Thistle \u2014 or at least, the stereotype attached to their fellow Acanthus. The Daoine emulate the high courts of the Fae: the sidhe lords of the British Isles are their exemplars, and the Daoine comport themselves with the solemn, ethereal grace of Arcadia\u2019s lords. Most Daoine adhere to a strong code of etiquette, instilled in them by their tutors, and put great stock in proper behavior. A crass or boorish individual finds it much harder to secure a Daoine\u2019s aid than someone who is gracious, polite and respectful.</div><div>The exact code of hospitality varies from mage to mage. Some Daoine put great stock in old tales of mortal dealings with the Fair Folk. Other Daoine expect the formal decorum of Victorian gentry, Islamic hospitality or good old-fashioned American neighborliness.</div><div>Anyone who thinks the Daoine are nothing but Miss Manners with Supernal knowledge would make a  grave mistake. The Good Folk (so nicknamed because, like the faeries the Daoine imitate, to call them by an unkind name may invite their wrath) bring justice. Not the common justice of putting a murderer behind bars or returning a stolen car, but the justice of the Fae, little remembered now outside of faerie tales and folklore. Few mages command such a mastery of hexes and curses as the Daoine, and few are as willing \u2014 some might say eager \u2014 to employ them. Many Daoine take particular glee in drawing upon the old faerie tales for inspiration in their methods: abusive parents who lock their child in the basement find themselves trapped in a crashed car whose doors won\u2019t open and whose windows won\u2019t break, sinking into the water, or a murderer slips and falls in the same incinerator he used to dispose of the evidence.</div><div>Some Daoine serve the Awakened community as hexers-for-hire, agents of fate who redress grievances between mages \u2014 for the right price. Every action has an equal reaction, the Daoine reason, and, likewise, every accomplishment requires a sacrifice of some sort. Other members of this Legacy show more altruistic motives, punishing those who criminals the Sleeper authorities cannot or will not prosecute. Those individuals who exploit children, whether for labor, sex or merely the thrill of dominating another human being, are especially likely to draw a Daoine\u2019s ire: the Good Folk despise those who abuse the human race\u2019s most helpless members.</div><div>In many ways, the Daoine are relics of an older time, when justice was harsh and mercy rare. The Good Folk see their duty as the balancing hand of fate, ensuring that good and evil receive their just deserts. To this end, Daoine also use their mastery of Fate in beneficial ways. Some rewards are quickly arranged: a Daoine sees a man give a lady his seat on the bus; later that evening, the gentleman finds $50 in the gutter. Other times, the Daoine put as much careful thought and effort into rewarding the just as punishing the wicked. In keeping with the Daoine\u2019s belief in a karmic balance, many Daoine would like to bestow as many rewards as punishments. Sadly, in the World of Darkness, they are called upon for the latter much more often than the former.</div>",alternateNickname:"Good Folk",orders:"Most Daoine find themselves drawn to the Adamantine Arrow or the Guardians of the Veil, depending upon the individual\u2019s personality. Daoine of the Arrow are often the most forthright, using their curses to right wrongs and punish the wicked. They often serve in a support capacity, using their mastery of Fate magic to hinder their enemies both directly (causing attacks to go awry and defenses to fail) and indirectly (disrupting enemy supply lines and communications). Daoine in the ranks of the Guardians of the Veil focus less on punishing the wicked and more on punishing the transgressions of their fellow mages. The Daoine are often fanatical in their devotion to upholding the strictest possible secrecy, and have a not-wholly-undeserved reputation for overkill in dealing with mages who expose Sleepers to the Awakened world.<div>Silver Ladder Daoine most commonly fit the \u201cvengeance-broker\u201d stereotype, trading their mystical punishments for tass, magical artifacts or even filthy lucre.

Such features become especially pronounced when a Daoine shows her nimbus.",background:"Daoine share a strong belief in justice, as both an abstract concept and as a natural law (what goes around, comes around). Even before Awakening, these men and women believed there was, or should be, a cosmic force ensuring that each person gets what he or she deserves in the end. Some Daoine are calmly philosophical about this concept, while others rail passionately about the wrongness of the world when confronted with perceived injustices. Even those Daoine who do not necessarily believe that a higher power metes out cosmic justice usually hold strong notions about how the world should be, even if it seldom seems to work that way.

Some Daoine recognize the sacred bonds of respect and deference that link student to teacher: these Daoine typically maintain cordial relationships with their teachers long after the apprenticeships are ended. Unfortunately, the personalities attracted to the Daoine Legacy often dislike abasing themselves. These mages tolerate subservience just long enough to learn what they feel they need from their mentors, then burn their bridges with startling alacrity and depart. These Daoine seldom progress to their third attainment: Good Folk who betray a trust and a contract show they don\u2019t understand one of the Legacy\u2019s most important precepts.<div>Now and then, Daoine come together in cabals of three called Moirae, after the Fates of Greek mythology. Moirae sometimes come together out of happenstance, but most often one mage decides that a particular task is too great to handle alone. She puts out a subtle call through the webs of Fate that brings a Moirae together. Daoine refer to this process as \u201cdrawing threes,\u201d and often use Tarot cards or similar divinatory tools to gain insight into the natures of their companions. Members of a Moirae often find they were already working on the same problem from different angles or in different locations. </div><div>Traditionally, each member of a Moirae fills a specific role and brings knowledge of a specific Arcanum to the group, though, in modern times, this tradition is optional. One member, referred to as Clotho (or sometimes the Clotho; Daoine differ on whether the roles are meant as names or titles), studies Life magic. The second, Lachesis, is expected to have skill with Time. Finally, the Atropos delves into the ends of all things and studies Death. When the youngest and oldest mages can take the roles of Clotho and Atropos, the Daoine consider it an extremely good omen. Despite the thematic links with the Greek Fates, men are not discouraged or prohibited from joining Moirae.</div>",suggestedOblations:"Weaving at a loom, visiting faerie rings at the solstices or equinoxes, bringing vengeance without the use of magic on one who has wronged you, publicly calling down a curse on someone who deserves it, rewarding someone else\u2019s act of generosity without that person knowing your involvement",concepts:"Hex assassin, mystical vigilante, social reformer, Awakened prosecutor, vengeance-broker",historySocietyCulture:"<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>The customs and attainments of this Legacy date back thousands of years; nobody knows where and when they began. \u201cDaoine\u201d itself is a Gaelic word for the faerie-folk. However, some mages trace the Legacy\u2019s name to Athena, whom the Greeks called Goddess of Just Deserts and companion of the Fates. Other mages trace the Daoine to the djinni of Arab legend. Most modern Daoine, however, say their Legacy has no distinct origin. They were fated to exist; and they shall endure as long as Fate decrees.</div><div>The Daoine Legacy certainly existed in the British Isles as long as the Celtic people themselves. As British influence spread from the 17th to the 19th centuries, this tiny Legacy spread as well and encountered similar (and equally ancient) Legacies that shared their philosophy of justice and vengeance: the Greek Moirae of Athena, the Scandinavian Norns, disciples of Raven and Coyote in the New World and others. The Victorian belief in British superiority extended to Awakened Britons. Even though the predominantly Scottish and Irish Daoine had their own historic experience of oppression, some hubris-ridden Daoine tried to absorb their \u201cerrant cousins\u201d abroad. A few brief but intense wizards\u2019 wars all ended badly. By the close of the 19th century, the militant mages on all sides met colorful dooms at each others\u2019 hands.</div><div>The surviving Daoine let Fate itself decide their future. Their divinations told them to make peace. Other Legacies received similar advice. The European Legacies formalized their union at the ancient oracular cave of Delphi; they drew lots for the composite Legacy\u2019s name, and \u201cDaoine\u201d won. The Legacy now draws its images, jargon and practices equally from Greek, Norse and Celtic traditions. The new Daoine became the dominant Legacy of justice-dealers in the Western world.</div><div>Similar Legacies from non-European cultures remain independent. These smaller, parallel Legacies still hold grudges from the colonial era. In the new millennium, however, some quasi-Daoine show new interest in cooperation. Several times during the last few years, Daoine assembling a Moirae have been led to Indian, Middle Eastern or Native American mages. Who are the Daoine to argue with Fate?</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>The Daoine are an insular bunch. Their unusual sense of propriety and etiquette makes other mages leery of socializing with the Daoine too closely. For the most part, the Daoine don\u2019t mind this at all. Few outside their own Legacy truly understand the importance of proper decorum, after all. Daoine tend to hold themselves aloof from the rest of mage society, paying lip service at best to the Consilii and operating as mavericks (they would say, \u201cimpartial observers\u201d). This attitude may cause conflict with the Sentinels, who (perhaps rightly) see the Daoine as dangerous wildcards in mage society. Even Daoine who recognize the rule of a Consilium are often watched closely by its Sentinels, whether they deserve the scrutiny or not. Ironically, those Daoine who become Sentinels often become frighteningly good at their job.</div><div>The core philosophy that unites the Daoine is one of balance, of a karmic harmony that punishes vice and rewards virtue. In this, they share certain beliefs with the Obrimos, but where the Theurgists focus on doing good works, the Daoine emphasize punishment for those who do ill. The Daoine call this balance the Scales of Wyrd, but that analogy is a gross oversimplification. Every life, and every action that affects a single life, also affects countless others in ways both great and small. The Scales are not merely a balance of right versus wrong, but a vast spiderweb of interconnected strands, where pushing even slightly on one changes the balance of thousands or millions of others.</div><div>The sheer complexity of the Scales inevitably creates conflict between Daoine. Even masters of Fate magic cannot read an action\u2019s full impact on the Scales, and each Daoine\u2019s personal bias influences his view of the proper means to put things right. Moirae serve as a check on intra-Legacy conflict; when all three members reach the same judgment, they can be sure they have read the Scales right and their intervention will serve the greater balance.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>The path to becoming a Daoine is a long and arduous one, and few have the requisite mindset to complete it successfully. Daoine are notoriously harsh toward their students, driving them mercilessly with meaningless tasks, exhausting chores and constant belittlement. This is done not out of spite (at least, not most of the time), but rather to impress upon the aspirant that his current place in the Scales is a lowly one, and if he is to prove worthy of the lofty place of a Daoine, he must fully comprehend the place of all things, from the highest to the lowest. Assuming the prospective Daoine survives the grueling initiation, things only get worse.</div><div>The typical induction into the Daoine involves the aspirant locating one of the Good Folk and petitioning for tutelage. The seeker is promptly ignored, sometimes for hours, sometimes days or weeks. This technique is most popular with Daoine who make their homes in harsh climates\u2014bitterly cold mountains, sweltering deserts and so on. Daoine in more temperate regions favor setting the applicant to menial tasks that in no way involve magic: maintaining the grounds outside the sanctum, running errands and similar mundane tasks that keep the apprentice out of the tutor\u2019s sanctum (or wherever the tutor calls home). The exact method varies, but the point is to test the apprentice\u2019s determination to join the Daoine. An apprentice who gives up and departs before being allowed into the tutor\u2019s home is dismissed as unworthy and never again given the opportunity to join.</div><div>At some point, once the tutor is convinced of the apprentice\u2019s determination, the Daoine\u2019s doors are opened and the apprentice is permitted to enter. This is an occasion fraught with significance for the Good Folk \u2014 even if the apprentice has briefly been inside the mage\u2019s home or sanctum (for example, to deliver a package or receive instructions), this is considered to be her first admittance into her tutor\u2019s home. The apprentice is treated as an honored guest and welcomed with a ritual of hospitality the tutor considers appropriate. Depending upon the tutor and the apprentice, this ritual may be as formal as a Japanese tea ceremony or as informal as a few beers and a football game. Most Daoine choose rituals that will make their apprentices comfortable, but if the apprentices have been persistently annoying or disrespectful during the first portion of the training, the tutors may deliberately choose rituals of hospitality that will make the apprentices feel out of their element. Regardless of the nature of the ritual, it is the last kindness an apprentice can expect from her tutor for quite some time.</div><div>Once the apprentice has been formally accepted, her tutelage begins. She undergoes rigorous training in uses of the Fate Arcanum, in addition to studying the Arcana of Time and Space. At this point in the apprentice\u2019s initiation, she is not taught the famous hexes the Legacy is known for; her instruction focuses on the ability to read the Scales of Wyrd and understand the place of all things within it. Most tutors sequester their charges for the duration of this first portion of training, but some, especially traveling Daoine, take their apprentices \u201cinto the field\u201d so that they might learn to see and understand the Scales in the real world. The menial chores do not abate during this period of the apprentice\u2019s instruction, though their purpose has changed from testing the apprentice\u2019s determination to ingraining in her the knowledge that her station is below her tutor\u2019s.</div><div>Once the apprentice has achieved the Legacy\u2019s first attainment, she embarks on the next stage of her teaching. She knows how to read the complex weaving of the Scales of Wyrd; now she learns how to sense transgressors against the Scales and how to punish them for upsetting the order of the cosmos. Once the apprentice has mastered the first attainment, she is considered a Daoine proper, albeit a low-ranking apprentice whose word may be gainsaid without question by any Daoine of higher rank. As the apprentice works toward mastery of the second attainment, her menial duties decrease in favor of more esoteric study. She often accompanies her tutor in the investigation of disruptions to the natural order, serving as an aide-de-camp or secondary investigator. If the apprentice\u2019s tutor trains multiple apprentices, this apprentice might be put in charge of one or more lower-ranked students.</div><div>Tutors suggest that apprentices should use their free time to look for chances to punish the wicked and reward the virtuous. Apprentices are encouraged to keep their interventions small and subtle until they learn to read the Scales of Wyrd, but an apprentice who successfully sets right a grievous wrong (such as breaking up a child-slavery ring or seeing that a serial killer meets the same fate as his victims) is sure to earn her tutor\u2019s esteem.</div><div>By the time a Daoine masters his second attainment, he has proven himself a skilled diviner of the great Scales of Wyrd and demonstrated his discretion in upholding the justice of Fate. Other Daoine no longer consider him a mere apprentice, though he still studies with his tutor. He is still expected to defer to Daoine of the third attainment, but he cannot simply be shouted down as a lower-ranked apprentice might. His tutor does not set him to menial labor or dictate his life; the apprentice is a colleague now.</div><div>As a Daoine progresses toward the third attainment, she may learn the most vicious curses the Daoine have devised over the centuries. The Good Folk know ancient hexes both subtle and insidious \u2014 and powerful enough to make the worlds tremble. Before imparting the third attainment, however, a tutor may set insidious tests to learn the student\u2019s ability to temper her wrath to fit the severity of the transgression. Depending on the tutor, the apprentice fail the test if she overreacts, or she might anger her tutor and fail the test if she is too temperate. Most importantly, can she read the Scales of Wyrd subtly enough to anticipate what her tutor wants?</div><div>Once the apprentice has mastered the third attainment of the Daoine, he or she is truly a lord or lady among the Legacy\u2019s ranks. If the apprentice and her tutor remain on cordial terms, the apprentice may remain nearby to assist her former teacher in the instruction of new apprentices or merely to work closely with one whose wisdom she acknowledges, but most Daoine strike out on their own. Some content themselves with continuing their work minding the Scales of Wyrd, while others continue their quest for knowledge and seek the elusive, semi-mythical fourth attainment. Of the success or failure of the latter Daoine, no reliable records exist, but that does not stop some Daoine from continuing to pursue the fourth attainment. If any of the Good Folk have reached this legendary degree of mastery, they must be among the most powerful masters of Fate in the world.</div>",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"The mystic arts of the Daoine focus on perceiving the Scales of Wyrd that guide their actions, and punishing those who step outside their place. Daoine vengeance is seldom of the vulgar fireballs-and-thunderbolts variety (though the occasional transformation of an entire household into mice is not unheard of). The Good Folk like their vengeance both subtle and terrible. If a target can never be sure whether he is the victim of a Daoine and not just unlucky, they reason, their own mystique and aura of fear remains strong.",firstAttainmentName:"The Eye and the Fist",firstAttainmentPrerequisites:"Gnosis 3, Fate 2 (primary), Space 1, Occult 2",firstAttainmentDescription:"<div>The most basic ability a Daoine must possess is the ability to sense the Scales of Wyrd and the myriad connections that make up that vast, tangled tapestry.

To the mage\u2019s sight, the world becomes a bright, shining web of interconnections and tangled threads, taut as piano wires and constantly shifting as though weighed on great, invisible scales. The constant shift and swell of these connections can be somewhat disorienting at first, but the Daoine learn to focus selectively on the objects of their interest, filtering out distractions to focus on what they wish to know.</div><div>This attainment is the most basic ability of the Good Folk, and is instrumental to their work as the guardians of the Scales of Wyrd. Thus, the basic divinatory power of this attainment is used almost constantly, whenever a Daoine suspects that the Scales have been disturbed or are at risk. Surprisingly, despite the Daoine\u2019s curse-happy reputation, most prefer to employ more subtle means of righting wrongs, especially if the transgressor is a Sleeper. When those methods fail, however, the Daoine do not hesitate to throw hexes.</div><div>This attainment allows the mage to use the Space 1 \u201cCorrespondence\u201d spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 232), allowing him to sense the sympathetic connections that make up the Scales of Wyrd at will.

The Daoine may also curse people using the Fate 2 \u201cThe Evil Eye\u201d spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 151), allowing him to inflict bad luck at will. Use the mage\u2019s Fate dots as successes for the purpose of determining the effects of the attainment. The Daoine may not curse an individual more than once in any period between two moonrises with this attainment.

This attainment is especially popular when the target of the Daoine\u2019s wrath has an over-fondness for material objects.</div><div>The implementation of this attainment varies widely from Daoine to Daoine. Each seems to have his own preferred method of cursing, some based in the lore of faeries from their homeland, others apparently made up out of whole cloth. Popular methods include, but are not limited to, intoning dire portents of doom, spewing invective and vicious curses \u2014 and even mocking rhymes or satirical dances \u2014 their apparent absurdity underscoring the inherent power of the curse. Less theatrical Daoine might settle for walking three times widdershins around the object to be cursed, sprinkling it with saltwater or scratching a small mark on the object with the claw of a black cat.</div><div>As with the first attainment, Daoine rarely use their hexing powers on Sleepers.

Thus, this attainment is generally reserved for use on the Awakened, other supernatural creatures or very superstitious Sleepers who might deduce that their misfortunes are due to powerful curses.</div><div>This attainment allows the character to use the Fate 3 \u201cMonkey\u2019s Paw\u201d spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 155, allowing him to put a curse of ill luck on an object).

For 20 years he did not leave the top of the tall pole.</div><div>One day, when the sun was highest in the sky, a figure came to the hermit.

This creature said its name was Lucian the Bodiless, and it asked the Pillar Saint what he was doing.</div><div>The Pillar Saint responded, \u201cI am sitting atop this pillar. I have denied the Devil and all demons. I no longer submit to the physical world. I do not need food or water. Sleep is a distant dream.\u201d</div><div>Lucian asked him why. \u201cTo make my spirit pure,\u201d the Pillar Saint said. \u201cI rely upon nothing in this world except my soul.\u201d The bodiless figure laughed like a dust devil spinning on the ground.

These distractions are not little things such as loud noises or a favorite television program. The Fallen Pillar sees most human desires as soul-stifling luxuries.</div><div>Exultants seek to liberate themselves from these fetters of desire. However, they do not expect a mage to throw off the shackles of the material world overnight. Fallen Pillars recognize that humankind has become addicted \u2014 not just to things like drugs or drink \u2014 but to a bevy of physical \u201cnecessities.\u201d Emancipating oneself from these addictions is a long and certainly an arduous process. Mages of this Legacy traverse a series of steps they call the Three Liberations.</div><div>Some Exultants call this process \u201cpruning the vine.\u201d When a plant grows too lushly, it must be cut back to a single vine or stalk, or it may die from its own excess. An act that looks like mutilation actually heals. Human desires grow more rankly than any vine or weed, with grave consequences for the health of the soul. They, too, need curbing.</div><div>Once an Exultant rids herself of one set of distractions, she should begin working on the next. She is only truly allowed to move to the next Liberation after she proves herself to an Exultant of greater experience. The senior Exultant decides what test proves the student\u2019s achievement. A tutor might ask his charge to live with him for a year to demonstrate her emancipation, or he might instead put her through a series of quick and rigorous challenges. Some Exultants use magic to read the minds and souls of their juniors, while other tutors ask for physical evidence.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Liberation From Want</h4><div>Most mages of this Legacy are at this stage. They seek to free themselves from the things they want. A mage\u2019s wants can include nearly anything: drugs, alcohol, sex, video games, television, the Internet or co-dependent relationships. A mage at this stage seeks to unburden herself of such needless cravings.</div><div>Exultants at this level are not total ascetics. They neither harm their own bodies by cutting or branding the flesh nor do they submit to a regimen of starvation and thirst. They endeavor only to a spartan austerity. Their homes and sanctums are likely empty of decoration. They sleep on cots or pallets. Clothing and hairstyles serve only practicality, not fashion. They drink only water and eat small meals, usually bland. They reject gadgetry and sever any physical relationships. At this phase, the Exultants begin the process of hollowing out themselves and their lives.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Liberation From Need</h4><div>Three primary needs dominate human life: food, water and shelter. At this stage, a Fallen Pillar distances himself as much as possible from this trifecta of human requirements. First, he leaves his home. He may not dwell within a physical shelter for more than a few nights at a time, and, even then, he will only do so if conditions become so harsh that he would die otherwise. Most mages at this stage become nomads, sleeping on the ground or in alleys. Exultants reject comfort, and learn to feel at ease out in the open, in whatever environment they find themselves. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s the asphalt jungle or a real jungle \u2014 the Exultant makes every step his home.</div><div>Fallen Pillars also reject hunger. They do not renounce food \u2014 only the most powerful mages can truly live without eating. Rather, the mages deny their desires for food. They must grow comfortable with hunger, even revel in it. When their bellies growl in the hollows below bared ribs, the mages must rejoice in their disavowals of need. They should push themselves to the brink of death before finally eating. And, when they do eat, they do not do so out of desperation, wolfing down handfuls of food. When they finally decide to eat, they eat little: a handful of nuts, a few leaves plucked from an herb garden, a few berries in the palm of the hand. The mages eat the bare minimum of what their bodies require.</div><div>Fallen Pillars at this level can use magic to push themselves further. They don\u2019t see this as a weakness. Magic is a tool to be used. Unlike material things, magic isn\u2019t a distraction, and so it is perfectly acceptable if an Exultant uses her magic to keep her body running beyond the point of starvation (Life 2 \u201cBody Control\u201d is especially useful; see p. 182 of Mage: The Awakening.) The attainments of this Legacy are also helpful in this regard.</div><div>Third comes the mages\u2019 refusal of thirst. As with hunger, the mages don\u2019t reject water, just the desire for it. The suffering of thirst \u2014 dry mouth, weakened body, dizziness \u2014 must be overcome. When the mages drink, they drink only water, and only as much as they need to survive. Again, magic and attainments can be used to push themselves to new extremes.</div><div>Exultants are expected to take on other characteristics at this time. While they are not required to begin branding or scarring themselves yet, mages of this Legacy are expected to cover themselves with tattoos. Inking one\u2019s flesh hurts. It draws blood. It separates the mage from everybody else and makes the body an artificial thing, an expression of the mind instead of a brute accident of nature. The design of the tattoos are up to each Exultant, but many choose patterns of thorny vines, magical symbols or faux injuries.</div><div>Mages of the Fallen Pillar also tend to wear very little clothing at this stage. Whatever they wear should be meager \u2014 it might mean stripping down to their undergarments or even wearing rags and sacks. Only in completely adverse conditions are these mages expected to wear anything more. Even then, it\u2019s not unusual to see an Exultant stepping lightly through a snowstorm wearing nothing but a T-shirt and a pair of ragged jeans. At no point do they wear shoes.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Liberation From Fear</h4><div>Older Exultants become paragons of asceticism, though few mages ever reach this stage. By now, they\u2019ve unchained themselves from all indulgences and necessities. They are likely tattooed, with their skin bitten by frost or reddened by the sun. They might be completely bald, having shorn every millimeter of hair from their entire bodies. Alternately, they might be so hairy that they look like wild men with unkempt manes (of both beard and hair) that could serve as nests for birds. How much further can they go?</div><div>This stage is all about separating oneself from fear. To reject fear, Fallen Pillars are not expected to avoid it, but to confront it directly. They must dance around their fears, laughing, making their fears smaller than themselves \u2014 so small, in fact, that the fears can be eaten like a berry or stepped on like a bug.</div><div>Some fears are base and simple (phobias of spiders, snakes, darkness), whereas others are infinitely more complex (fear of abandonment, betrayal, intolerance). Every fear must be challenged, defied and defeated. A phobia of spiders means the mage must not only cover herself in spiders, but she must stay close to them at all times, living with them, becoming them for a time if she has sufficient magical power. If the mage fears loneliness, then he must abandon himself. He must leave civilization for a time, and perhaps even leave his own body.</div><div>All mages \u2014 in fact, all people \u2014 are driven by two fears greater than all others. Everyone fears life and death.</div><div>All are afraid to live and feel without restraint, to experience the massive highs and lows of every emotion \u2014 joy and sorrow, anger and tranquility. Mages of the Fallen Pillar must embrace these emotions, for they are pure. But the mages must also learn not to lose themselves within the emotions, or let them become another drug. Anger comes, but should also be allowed to leave. Joy is the same.</div><div>The fear of death presents its own challenges. All suffering points to this fear, because death is the great unknown. Mages at this stage do not try to escape the fear of death by learning Death magic. An Exultant snubs death by showing it that she does not care about it one way or another. She lets death know that she will meet it head on with glowing eyes and a blood-smeared grin. To do this, she hurts herself. Each Exultant chooses his own forms of pain. He may bite or claw himself. Perhaps he cuts himself with razors or burns brands into his flesh. Some Exultants go to further extremes and castrate themselves or remove other parts. To truly see beyond death, some Exultants decide to be blind. To learn how to communicate the secrets of fear, they may cut out their tongues.</div><div>Such bodily mortification is done with jubilance. Exultants sing hymns to the trees as they bleed from their injuries; Exultants run laughing down the city streets with skin still sizzling from fiery wounds. Many Exultants also become mad martyrs at this stage. Caring little for their physical life means they can leap into battle with complete abandon. They might jump in front of swords to save friends, or even go into an enemy\u2019s lair armed with mean magic and backpacks full of explosives.</div><div>The point of all this is to prove to themselves that the soul matters, not the physical form. The body is temporary; the soul is permanent. One\u2019s flesh is little more than a suit of clothing. Over time, all fabrics fray.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Scouring</h3><div>Exultants are taught early on that it is not only acceptable to scour their Patterns for Mana, but it is encouraged. Mana is the energy of the spirit, forever food for the soul. The body, on the other hand, is weak and temporary. If one is in desperate need of food for the spirit, then it is fine for the body to suffer. Mages working on the Liberation from Fear regularly diminish their Attributes and Health to fuel their magical abilities: Pattern scouring becomes their first source of Mana for spells, rather than their last. </div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Duality</h3><div>The only relationship that matters inside the Legacy is the one between tutor and apprentice. The tutor (also called \u201cliberator\u201d) helps to shepherd the apprentice (also \u201cslave\u201d) through the Liberations. While the mages of this Legacy aren\u2019t discouraged from association with other members, it is by no means required. However, no liberator should work with more than one slave. Every apprentice is different. What works for one does not work for all, and every pupil deserves a tutor\u2019s undivided attention.</div><div>The bond between liberator and slave is meant to be permanent. Only death should sever the tie between them. The Fallen Pillar teaches that while the liberator frees the slave from the material world, the liberator himself is also liberated in the process. Many tutors and apprentices join cabals together. Even when they don\u2019t, they still maintain a close connection, and often meet one another in dreams or the Shadow Realm.</div><div>One of the less-noted responsibilities of the liberator is punishment. The Liberations are difficult, and slaves may \u201cfall off the wagon\u201d from time to time. This is expected, but not allowed to go unpunished. Chastisement is often harsh, and generally tailored toward the nature of the slave\u2019s transgression. If an apprentice fell back into an old drug addiction, then she and her tutor may go out together to destroy the dealer who sells the poison. If an apprentice cannot abide his starvation, he may be force-fed so much food that he becomes sick for days or even ruptures his stomach lining (which the liberator will heal \u2014 eventually). Many tutors keep punishment simple: pain. They cane their apprentices, cut them, brand them or do whatever it takes to cauterize the spiritual wounds.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Anchoritic Masters</h3><div>Legends of the Fallen Pillar say that members who achieve the final Liberation are visited by one of the Anchoritic Sages. These reclusive Exultants invite the mage to join their ranks. If a mage accepts the invitation, she goes away with the Anchorite and is never seen again. If she rebuffs the Anchorite, she is purportedly destroyed.</div><div>No one can prove the Anchoritic Sages exist or that they don\u2019t. (Most teachers recognize the paradox in the stories: one way or another, no one who receives the Anchorites\u2019 invitation could ever tell anyone else about it.) Legacy legend certainly offers a number of tales about Sages who act without announcing themselves, and other Exultants only later guess what they must have been. These tales suggest that the Anchorites are truly liberated beings. They do not eat or sleep. Their bodies are skin-draped skeletons, and yet they are vibrant with the vigors of life. Many Anchorites are supposedly missing body parts, and yet have \u201cphantom\u201d limbs that replace the amputated pieces. Other stories suggest the Sages are accomplished body-jumpers, hopping between animal and human bodies daily, never staying in one \u201cshell\u201d too long.</div><div>One ironic tale, however, tells how an Exultant encountered a mage who claimed he was an Anchoritic Sage. The Anchorite did not match any of the earlier descriptions, and was in fact a normal-looking man in a business suit. He had a briefcase in one hand, a cell phone in the other and stood at a hot dog stand ordering his lunch. When the Exultant asked why the self-styled Sage had abandoned his training, he simply declared that he had \u201cliberated himself from the Liberations,\u201d and was, as such, \u201cutterly enlightened.\u201d Then he laughed, and headed for the subway.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Acceptance of Bliss</h3><div>Mages of the Fallen Pillar are taught to take comfort and joy in their asceticism. The Legacy does not tell them to become morose monks or weeping flagellants. Jubilation, they\u2019re told, results from strengthening the spirit. Each scar comes with laughter. Starvation and thirst deserve howls of triumph. The fact that they call their actions \u201cLiberations\u201d instead of \u201cDenials\u201d is very telling. The Exultants see such deprivations as chances for new possibilities, not closings off of potential. The Exultants take pleasure in their lack of pleasure.</div><div>Curiously, the Legacy does not shun loving relationships. The Exultants deny themselves physical love, but not emotional or spiritual love. Many Legacy members fall in love. Few Exultants frown upon such behavior, provided the relationship does not become physical. In their eyes, denying love a physical expression strengthens the emotional bond between lovers, by removing the selfish desire for pleasure. Sexual love is an anchor. Without it, two (or more) people can be free.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Interactions</h3><div>Mages of the Fallen Pillar inspire strong and opposite reactions from other mages. Exultants tend to be incredibly loyal, nearly to a fault, and commit themselves to every task with zealous delight. However, this self-abandoning passion so frightens some mages that they refuse to accept an Exultant as a cabal-mate or even acquaintance. Whispered stories tell of old, powerful Exultants who saw their cabals as \u201cextensions\u201d of their own bodies. As such, they had little problem casually throwing their cabal-mates into battles they couldn\u2019t win, lashing them with Paradox or forcing their weak minds to share their asceticism. Are these tales true? Perhaps. While many mages of the Fallen Pillar are wise and focused individuals, any mage can fall to hubris and decide that nothing matters except her own will.</div><div>The Exultants encourage members to join cabals. Exultants believe the soul suffers when it lacks company. Fallen Pillar tenets don\u2019t demand that members try to \u201cconvert\u201d their cabal-mates to the Legacy\u2019s ways. Exultants do not judge what others do or ask that their allies \u201cliberate\u201d themselves from material entanglements.</div><div>That doesn\u2019t mean that only a cabal benefits from an Exultant\u2019s presence. The Liberations aren\u2019t easy: some mages free themselves with complete and total success every time, but most experience setbacks. In many ways, the cabal goes along for the ride and shares the successes and failures. The other mages witness the suffering and occasional madness of their Exultant cabal-mate. A time may come when the Exultant is too weak to perform whatever task the cabal needs done (though he\u2019ll surely try). As an Exultant grows in age and power, he may become reckless with his own life. This Legacy produces many martyrs. Although Exultants can help their friends with a truly transcendent loyalty, mages who don\u2019t care about their own safety and sanity may forget that their allies do not share the Exultants\u2019 flippant disregard.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Other Principles</h3><div>The Exultants follow various other precepts with greater or lesser zeal. These principles are not universal like the Liberations. A tutor may forgo some or all of these precepts, according to her own taste or what she thinks would best serve her pupil\u2019s enlightenment.</div><ul><li>Physical items are crutches an Exultant should throw away. Magical items are seen similarly. Most Exultants prefer to work without Artifacts, Enhanced items or Imbued items.</li><li>This disavowal of material objects doesn\u2019t include magical tools. A mage may get along without magical tools most of the time \u2014 but failing an exercise of the soul\u2019s power from refusal to use a tool is vanity, not liberation. Exultants prefer simple tools made from the body or from nature (blood, tree branches, strips of skin, animal pelts). The Legacy\u2019s favorite tool is a knife. Many Exultants make their own knives with unadorned wooden handles and hand-sharpened shivs of metal.</li><li>Few Exultants own libraries or sanctums. If an Exultant does have a library, it is something that can travel with the mage. Some Exultants carry backpacks full of notepads. A few Exultants carve Arcane knowledge into their bare flesh or scribe grimoires on parchment made from their own flayed skin.</li><li>As a Legacy, the mages of the Fallen Pillar are not pacifists. Many learn martial arts or craft their own \u201cstyles\u201d (which often include a lot of laughing, biting and leaping around). These mages rarely train with any weapons except knives, small wooden batons (such as escrima sticks) or similar improvised blunt weapons (broken chair legs, two-by-fours, broomsticks).</li><li>The Fallen Pillar Legacy accepts the use of some drugs that lack obvious addictive properties and offer some benefit to the spirit. For instance, some tutors allow the sparing use of hallucinogenic drugs, as a way to break old habits of thought. The Legacy only favors natural hallucinogens (peyote, mushrooms, ayahuasca, oo-koo-he). These drugs are sometimes used as sacraments for extended spellcasting.</li></ul><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>A tutor of the Fallen Pillar does not accept a pupil lightly. Exultants have no criteria for what kind of person can burn their souls in the forge of this Legacy, because such criteria are artificial. Saying \u201che must be this or she must be that\u201d means nothing, because a mage always appears who violates those characteristics and still makes a fine Exultant. The Fallen Pillar cares about what a mage does, not who he is. Actions, after all, speak louder than words.</div><div>Of course, a mage must be Thyrsus to learn the attainments. The Exultants gladly train mages of any persuasion and interest, though, helping them escape the cruel bonds of insanity and addiction. One can still live by the Fallen Pillar\u2019s joyful asceticism without actually belonging to the Legacy.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>A Hand in the Darkness</h3><div>Fallen Pillar mages do not always come to this Legacy on their own. No, many times tutors without apprentices (or slaves who are now ready to become liberators) will seek out new initiates. These Exultants look for Awakened who have fallen. Mages can be frail. Magic is wild and fickle, and some minds can\u2019t always handle the overwhelming power of touching the Supernal. Many fall to drink or drugs. Some lodge themselves in co-dependent relationships or binge sexually. Others become addicted to the magic itself, Paradox and caution be damned. When one hits the very bottom of the pit and the darkness seems impenetrable, an Exultant may come along and offer a hand to pull the poor soul up out of his hole.</div><div>A prospective tutor only makes this offer once. If a mage doesn\u2019t wish to join, fine. He can always choose to come of his own volition later. (The Fallen Pillar prefers this in some ways, for the applicant shows true interest and devotion.) </div><div>Other potential Exultants come seeking tutors all on their own. The mages of the Fallen Pillar are sights to behold: frail, scarred \u2014 and triumphant. They show a strange grandeur that pulls mages to them. Any who come or are invited are welcome to begin the arduous journey toward total liberation. First, however, they must show true dedication.</div><h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Offers on the Altar</h3><div>Every initiation is different, unique to the tutor. The theme of each initiation, however, is universal. A mage must show that she is capable of sacrifice. The liberator sets the nature of this sacrifice. It may be physical, emotional, social or spiritual. The liberator\u2019s personality comes through when setting the sacrificial requirement. A tutor whose body is a roadmap of chaotic scars may ask that the sacrifice be physical, an offer of pain and blood. If the tutor was once a methamphetamine addict, he may ask for his apprentice to free himself from some kind of worldly pleasure \u2014 or, stranger still, ask that the apprentice first addict himself to a potent substance and then show that he can free himself from it. Tutors may also tailor initiations to the applicants\u2019 personalities. Other potential sacrifices include the following:</div><ul><li>Cut off all the fingers and thumb on one hand. Live for a month without them, at which point the applicant or another mage may draw down the Supernal to heal them.</li><li>Live in solitary confinement for a week with only bread and water. The mage may leave confinement at any time before this by knocking on the door. Doing so voids her initiation.</li><li>Burn all her social bridges. She must sever any relationship she has, whether it\u2019s with a boyfriend, her mother or her old cabal-mates.</li><li>Scour himself for Mana, then use that Mana to fuel a spell that helps someone else.</li><li>If she is addicted to something (drugs, sex, food, magic), she must demonstrably separate herself from that thing. This might mean killing her dealer or destroying his stash. This might mean using magic to damage her sexual organs or pleasure centers. This might mean destroying her magical tools. A mage raised in the so-called comforts of urban civilization might be left in the woods or the desert for a week. Alternately, a nature-loving survivalist might be thrown into the urban sprawl for the same period of time.</li></ul>The slave complies and completes the sacrifice, or the slave is free to go. Mages can attempt their initiation three times. Thrice-failed means the doorway to liberation closes forever, from that Exultant at least. A candidate need not make his attempts one right after the other; in fact, he can take years between applications. Once the induction is complete, a mage may begin on the journey toward liberation.",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"<div>The attainments of the Fallen Pillar bring the Exultant further from the flesh and its cravings. The less she depends upon her own body, the more power she gains. These are the gifts of the ascetic, potent rewards for corporeal sacrifice.</div><div>Each of the three attainments roughly corresponds to the Three Liberations. A mage cannot gain an attainment until his tutor believes he has achieved the corresponding Liberation.

The mage may, as an instant action requiring no roll, subtract a number of dots from one Physical Attribute to appear weak. In the same action, he redistributes those dots to a different Physical Attribute. An Exultant who uses this attainment may take points away from Stamina, thus assuming an appearance of frailty or sickness. At the same time, he can bolster his Dexterity or Strength, so he can make stronger or quicker attacks. The end result is that the mage appears feeble (and with regard to one of his Physical Attributes, he is feeble), but is then able to redirect that energy into surprising an enemy with unexpected reserves of combat vigor.

In a great city, you can see a $300 a ticket theater show one night and lose your fortune on the stock market the next morning.

Cities buzz with all kinds of people and lifestyles, and the noisier the buzz, the bigger the draw. </div><div>As a Metropolitan becomes more in tune with the energy of a city, she can follow a ley line wherever she likes. In time, she can learn to see a web of subtler lines, what the Legacy calls Ariadne\u2019s thread, spun throughout the city.

All the threads together form the city\u2019s Knot. </div><div>These threads allow the city to communicate with the Metropolitans. Ariadne\u2019s thread can help a mage locate physical things, such as lost items or people, or abstract things, such as a safe hiding place away from prying magical eyes, Hallows or areas that have borne witness to great happiness, fear or other strong emotions.

Those who do belong to an order are seldom very dedicated members.<div>The Metropolitans do, of course, step on the orders\u2019 toes now and then. The Metropolitans claim the right to know everything that happens in the largest population centers in the world, and to interfere when they believe the city wants them to.

The House of Ariadne was founded on strife, but few brave warriors appear in Legacy\u2019s history. The Metropolitans prefer stealth and subtlety to combat.

Both groups pull strings from covert positions to orchestrate what they like, their tools stealth and subterfuge. However, most of the mages in the House of Ariadne do not belong to the Guardians of the Veil, and, therefore, this Legacy operates outside the control of the order. Sometimes the Guardians and the House work together to solve a mystery; more often, the House probes matters the Guardians wish to remain hidden.

The two groups rarely disagree; conflict arises only when the Mysterium wishes to keep something hidden, and the House of Ariadne wants it revealed. If the Mysterium hides something within a city, especially something magical, the House of Ariadne is likely to find it. The Legacy does not make a habit of thieving, however. The House\u2019s only precious possession is the city itself.</div><div>The Silver Ladder watches the House of Ariadne closely. Similar to the Guardians of the Veil, the Silver Ladder can see the Metropolitans as useful allies, or rogues who step out of line, pushing their cities on paths the Silver Ladder does not approve. They watch the House of Ariadne closely and interfere when they see need.</div><div>As the Seers of the Throne do with all mages save themselves, the Seers try to halt the Metropolitans\u2019 work. The Seers have no place in their world for crazy people who talk to cities \u2014 especially when the cities talk back.</div>",appearance:"A roomful of Metropolitans shows a broad cross-section of urban styles. Some members dress as (and are) wealthy socialites, viewing the city from a 30th story balcony. Other mages prefer to get closer to the underbelly and appear as rag-tag, cart-pushing homeless people. Still other Metropolitans are completely street, flaunting heavy, artistic tattoos, gaudy jewelry and gang colors. You don\u2019t see Metropolitans wearing overalls, pastel blouses or T-shirts with slogans matching their spouses\u2019. No one looking at the Metropolitans would assume anything but that they live in the city: not the suburbs, not the country, not the small towns or remote villages. The city, where people gather and live for reasons they don\u2019t understand \u2014 but the Metropolitans do.",background:"Few people who are not born city-dwellers choose this Legacy. A few suburbanites or country mages may find themselves drawn to the city and join the Legacy to understand the thread that dragged them there. Most Metropolitans, however, were born and raised in the city.<div>They grew up knowing the shortcuts, the best places to eat, the places not to go after dark. Often, they feel the city\u2019s pulse before they Awaken.</div><div>Sometimes they have a knack for finding lost things or knowing who\u2019s doing what in the neighborhood. Sometimes they walk the streets at night, heading nowhere in particular, just following paths they can\u2019t quite see.</div><div>The Metropolitans call this half-sensed path Ariadne\u2019s thread, and say their new members follow it to their destiny. After joining the Legacy, mages learn how to see Ariadne\u2019s thread stretching over the streets, through alleys, up elevator shafts and through old, forgotten shops. This thin, golden line appears when the mage wishes to find something, or merely wishes to meditate, walking throughout the city.</div>",organizzation:"Each city has one House; there are not multiple organizations in cities, even the larger ones. (Though the Legacy does not always follow the lines on a map in defining a city\u2019s limits.) Each House of Ariadne, in turn, is divided into two levels: the Trackers and the Weavers.<div>Most Metropolitans are Trackers. Even if mages have been Awakened for years, they still need time to learn how to see and follow Ariadne\u2019s thread. They practice by finding lost things and mapping the city\u2019s secrets. Even if the city is only 100 years old, and has held a House of Ariadne for most of those years, the city always has more secrets to tell \u2014 from a secret love affair when the city was a village of 25 families to a hot dog vendor who is slowly poisoning his regular patrons. As Trackers gain skill, they are assigned to find particular lost items or people.</div><div>Some Metropolitans have an easier time than others communing with the city. These mages rarely sleep, preferring to walk the streets and talk to the city. Sleepers often think these mages are crazy homeless people, since they do nothing but walk, murmuring to themselves. These mages want to learn all of the city\u2019s secrets and become honored lorekeepers among the House of Ariadne.</div><div>The Weavers are the most senior Metropolitans. They have at least their second attainment. Weavers supervise the other Metropolitans and manage the cities. Weavers plan the city\u2019s future based on its past, deciding whether the city will grow, decay or stay the same. No matter how much they love their city, they do understand when a city tells them it needs to change.</div><div>In the past, cities could die outright from war, plague, dynastic shifts or natural disasters. Nowadays, cities morph and change but seldom die outright. Sometimes they devour other towns or cities, or are devoured themselves. More subtly, cities can grow smaller towns within themselves, communities with their own customs and privileges. College campuses are often their own cities in the eyes of the House, as are the worst of the slums or the shantytowns beyond the railroad tracks.</div><div>Although Weavers can meddle with the city\u2019s fate, some Weavers simply sit back and wait for the city\u2019s future to play out, watching and chronicling. The Weavers also dedicate themselves to walking the Knot in the city, looking for Ariadne\u2019s Exit, as they call it, hoping to follow her thread to the Supernal Realm.</div>",suggestedOblations:"A walk in the city to find something you never saw before, exploring the subway tunnels, watching a sunrise or sunset from a penthouse apartment, visiting a museum or other tourist attraction, attending a party with a \u201clist,\u201d serving food at a homeless shelter, sleeping on a park bench",concepts:"Upper-class socialite, homeless person, the crazy man preaching on the corner, attention-loving movie star, stock broker, runaway, gang member, prostitute, pickpocket, con artist",historySocietyCulture:"<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>When Theseus entered the labyrinth of King Minos to kill the Minotaur, the king\u2019s daughter Ariadne fell for the handsome hero. She went to the inventor and architect Daedalus, who gave her a ball of string that would unwind and show Theseus his way back out of the labyrinth. Ariadne professed her love to Theseus and made him promise to take her home and marry her if she helped him kill the Minotaur and escape.</div><div>Theseus abandoned Ariadne on the island of Naxos. He betrayed her because she betrayed her people. Here, the myth says the god Dionysus fell in love with Ariadne, married her and made her immortal. Mages know better: They know Ariadne Awakened instead. With the help of priests on the island \u2014 and, later, with the help of her own magic \u2014 she built a massive fortress on top of a Hallow. Underneath, she built a Demesne, her own multi-leveled labyrinth she called the Knot. She kept the ball of thread that saved Theseus and walked the Knot daily with the thread\u2019s help, and, later, without it.</div><div>People, island citizens and sailors alike, were drawn to her fortress, and she welcomed them all. Soon the fortress became its own city, and Ariadne\u2019s power grew. Her followers included a few Awakened, looking for guidance. The somber mage taught them how to follow the thread of power that runs through large gatherings of people. She taught them how she had built her fortress-town along intersecting ley lines, but how countless other threads ran through it. A city, she claimed, remembered what happened within it, the good and the bad, and used the threads to point to areas of interest. These cities would last the ages, strengthened by the magic woven into them and the people who flocked there and remembering everything that happened within its borders. If you can connect with the city, you can learn its history and read its soul.</div><div>The House\u2019s legends tell how Ariadne\u2019s disciples pursued Theseus, secretly forcing him from his Athenian throne and into exile \u2014 removing him from his precious city just as he had lured their mistress away from hers. They harried him until he died. Ariadne threw a massive celebration when she heard the news. Sleepers and Awakened reveled for three days straight. Ariadne, after planning the party, retreated to her Demesne when the festivities began and spent the entire three days moodily walking the Knot.</div><div>Ariadne never took another lover, despite what Sleeper myths say. She had no desire to love again, and buried herself in her magical study and the expansion of her fortress and town.</div><div>Her somber mood rubbed off on her students; even today, Metropolitans are considered unusually dour for Acanthus.</div><div>Several years later, Ariadne disappeared while walking the Knot. Her most fervent students claim she finally followed her thread to the Supernal Realm. Cynics say she got lost, died and no one could find her body.</div><div>As the years passed, Ariadne\u2019s students emigrated to the cities of the world. Some students actually built the cities, laying their first streets according to Ariadne\u2019s mystic geometry. They confirmed that the cities that lasted hundreds of years, defying war, plague and other catastrophes, followed natural ley lines as well as Ariadne\u2019s thread, whether the House of Ariadne had influenced their building or not.</div><div>All the mages looked for students in their cities, focusing on people who endlessly prowled the city as if following something or just watched the city from balconies and rooftops. These Sleepers, and later Awakened, seemed lost, but the House of Ariadne thought they knew the way better than most. They merely look for a path that most people \u2014 including other Awakened \u2014 cannot see.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>Some Awakened view the House of Ariadne as madmen who cannot communicate with anyone or anything but their city. This is an extreme case. A few Metropolitans do nothing but wander the Knot of their city, but most Legacy members are functioning mages, serving their order and cabal as well as the House.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Secrets of the City</h3><div>Metropolitans spend most of their time investigating their own cities. Metropolitans track the city\u2019s history, learning everything from the location and use of the first building to the latest crappy apartment where a wannabe actor killed himself. Mystical information \u2014 ley lines, Hallows, Verges, places where magic was done and the haunts of ghosts and other supernatural creatures \u2014 hold a special interest for the House as mystical information does for most mages, but House members do not scorn even the most obscure or mundane details of urban life and history.</div><div>Houses vary in how they store this information. Butterfly Smith, a Weaver in Los Angeles, writes that city\u2019s history on spiral-bound notebooks that she carries in her shopping cart. Her magic protects her library from the elements, and her immediate proximity to it keeps it from prying eyes and stealing hands. At the other extreme, the Weavers of London built a grand library within the Underground. Eidechse, a tech-savvy Weaver in Hamburg, stores his House\u2019s histories on a server that is backed up daily. His most novice Metropolitan receives the job of securing the back-ups in a safe place. Hamburg\u2019s other Weavers express concern at giving such an important, if menial, job to a novice. But Eidechse claims that offering such trust teaches responsibility and dedication to the House. As of yet, Hamburg\u2019s House has suffered no security breach.</div><div>Other mages often go to the House of Ariadne for information. Sometimes these mages find what they seek, sometimes not. Though some Metropolitans keep immaculate records, others simply feel the act of writing down the city\u2019s lore is enough, and don\u2019t care whether they have a system to find the information later. Butterfly Smith knows who killed Nicole Brown Simpson, but she would be hardpressed to tell you which notebook holds the information. At other times, the city remembers such outrageous things that inquiring mages simply do not believe what the Metropolitans tell them. Many mages doubt the power of the Metropolitans, or refuse to believe that the city remembers its past and can speak with the Awakened.</div><div>The Metropolitans do not mind the disbelief too much. They know that cities do not lie, and mages are very likely to, so Metropolitans find it amusing when mages show such hypocrisy.</div><div>Metropolitans spend a lot of their time finding lost items or people. They do most of their searching for their House and the city itself. Members find artifacts (and sometimes Artifacts) and items for the Weavers to use in tending the city, or collect memorabilia of events a member thinks the city wants the House to know about.</div><div>A House may also serve as bloodhounds for other mages. The morals of each House change from city to city. In one city, the House helps the Consilium find mages who break the Lex Magica; in another, the Metropolitans serve as treasure-hunters-for-hire. A House may offer its services for the good of Awakened. More often, Metropolitans require payment. Other mages sometimes see the House as mercenary, but the Weavers simply ask such mages how often they serve other mages free.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Keepers of the City</h3><div>The Metropolitans do not merely spend their days communing with the city, treasure-hunting and collecting obscure historical trivia. They want to see where the city is currently going and, more importantly, where it needs to go. As Acanthus mages, they study the paths of Fate in a city as a natural progression. Metropolitans were there for the fall of Rome and the reunification of Berlin. They use their magic (beyond their attainments, of course) to push the city in the direction they wish it to go \u2014 or where the city itself wants to go. The Metropolitans have a hard time explaining the difference to other mages, or seeing it themselves.</div><div>Since they, alone, can commune with the city, Metropolitans see themselves as the keepers of the cities, and it is their job to know when to prune, when to encourage growth and when to purge. They love the cities, but love them as a gardener loves a rosebush that grows too far into the path; sometimes, even a beautiful thing must be cut back for its own good. Metropolitans have influenced mobs, fires, even wars. They have eyes inside the government and the offices of CEOs, anyone \u2014 Sleeper or Awakened \u2014 who has a hand in the city\u2019s future. The House of Ariadne is there to guide a potential destiny, or cut it off entirely.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Mystical Conflicts</h3><div>Predictably, the House\u2019s attitude upsets other mages who do not see their homes going up in flames as a good and natural thing. In these cases, the orders may interfere with the House of Ariadne. Some mages send spies to discover what the Metropolitans plan for their cities, and work directly against them. The House of Ariadne is used to this, of course. In addition to manipulating the city, Metropolitans also plot to head off the efforts of other mages. There are Metropolitans whose sole jobs are to watch what the other local mages do to change the city, and derail their plans if necessary.</div><div>Often these movements have to be as covert as possible, since the various orders won\u2019t abandon their plans just because the House of Ariadne wants the orders to. Several cities have stalled in their evolution simply because the House of Ariadne and an order (most often the Silver Ladder or the Seers) have locked horns, and no one seems able to win a clear victory. In the short term, other mages usually win conflicts against the House of Ariadne; Metropolitans just aren\u2019t fighters. In the long term, the struggles become more even. The House always seems to know more about its enemy\u2019s doings than vice versa, and Metropolitans are better at hiding and accumulating tiny, long-term advantages.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Rituals</h3><div>The House of Ariadne holds three yearly celebrations to honor the Legacy and the city.</div><div>The first ceremony takes place on the city\u2019s birthday, which is not always the day of its establishment in the Sleepers\u2019 bureaucratic records. The city knows when it was no longer a grouping of farmhouses or nomad tents and when it became a city. The Metropolitans ask the city where they should hold their celebration, and follow Ariadne\u2019s thread to that place. If it is a convention hall, they simply rent it; for an outside venue, they plan an outdoor party. In 1994, Dublin apparently instructed its Metropolitans to celebrate in the home of a descendant of a woman the city considered a hero 400 years before; persuading the woman to host a party for a bunch of strangers took a fair bit of blarney as well as magic. The celebration typically lasts an afternoon, and is open to the public, Sleepers and Awakened alike. The Metropolitans put a spin on the celebration, of course. In Boston, the city desires that Sleepers walk the thread of Ariadne once a year, so the House of Ariadne started the Boston Marathon, to weave the Sleepers through their city.</div><div>The second festival honors the House. This can happen on any date; some of the older Houses remember the day of Theseus\u2019 death and follow Ariadne\u2019s example of throwing a three-day bacchanalia in honor of the event. The newer cities, including most of the ones in North America, honor the date of the local House\u2019s inception. They, too, throw a three-day party, abandoning their duties to any other mages who may have hired them. No outsiders are invited to this celebration. The House prefers to gather at a Demesne constructed by senior members, allowing the mages to drop all caution and catering to the Lie. The head Weaver of the city\u2019s House spends the three days walking the Knot of the city in honor of Ariadne.</div><div>The third holiday is a somber ritual. The mages spend a week discerning where the city locates its heart; this changes as the city evolves. All of the Metropolitans then gather at the heart and meditate on the city\u2019s future, their dedication to the city and how they can better serve it. This does not differ terribly from the everyday meditations the mages may do, except they all do it at once, increasing the resonance and the connection with the city. Since this ritual likely takes place in front of Sleepers, the Metropolitans don disguises to look like a yoga group, exhausted tourists or even a political sit-in so that they do not attract too much unwanted attention. After the meditation is over \u2014 and this one has no time limit, the mages know from the city when it is time to sever the connection \u2014 they lock themselves away and discuss the plans for the coming year.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Although the House of Ariadne offers to train nearly anyone who asks, Metropolitans turn away mages who cannot see Ariadne\u2019s thread after a training period. Those who can see it without Metropolitan training are welcomed immediately. Of course, only an Acanthus mage can actually join the Legacy.</div><div>A Metropolitan needs patience, above all else. It takes time to wander the Knots and divine the secrets the city tells. Once a recruit proves she can see Ariadne\u2019s thread, she is taken to a spot in the city and told to follow the path. The mentor follows, not commenting, seeing if the prot\xe9g\xe9 can follow the path. The candidate is not told to find anything in particular, just to walk and meditate. If she hesitates or asks questions within one hour, she is told to walk the streets for a month, looking for Ariadne\u2019s thread, before she returns for more training. A mage accompanies her, concealed, to make sure she trains. A mage who follows the thread for two hours without speaking is accepted with the warning that much patience is needed. If a candidate walks for three hours, intent on the thread, she is welcomed into the House of Ariadne.</div><div>If an applicant cannot find the thread, the watchful Metropolitans remove themselves from the test and let the mage wander until he gives up. If he does not give up, and eventually tracks down his departed mentor, the House gives the applicant one more chance; any mage can have a bad day.</div><div>After induction, a tutor trains the pupil in the art of tracking, including people, items and abstractions. Periodically, House mentors test the mage\u2019s power to sense the city, question him on things that happened in a particular spot last night, a year ago, 10 years ago and so on. These tests are always subtle, a casual request made by a mentor in sequence with other commands. Get enough answers right, and the character receives invitations to more private meetings of senior House members. Mages who get too many answers wrong end up as Trackers for the rest of their lives, or the House gradually shuts them out and stops teaching.</div><div>The trial to become an elite Weaver tests a mage\u2019s personal strength. He is commanded to walk Ariadne\u2019s thread, meditating on his own death. If he can follow the path to face the symbol of his own death, the other Weavers welcome him to their ranks.</div><div>The meditation to discern one\u2019s own death takes three days of uninterrupted contemplation. The Weavers do not tell their students this; the Weavers use the time as a way to weed out any liars who claim to have seen their death within a couple of hours. At this point, the Weavers sever the candidates\u2019 ties with the Legacy and refuse to train, or speak to, the mages again. Their only chances are to move to new cities, and hope the House of Ariadne there does not speak to those Weavers who threw them out of their previous cities.</div><div>The House of Ariadne bases its entire Legacy on the premise that cities do not lie. Thus, Metropolitans must convey the city\u2019s truth in whole, not changing any of it. On occasion, the Weavers check the reports of novice members to see if they are lying or embellishing the truth. Any mage found lying is sent from his tutor without trial or explanation. Upon induction, the Weavers tell a new Metropolitan these rules, how truth protects the foundation of their Legacy and how one lie can weaken it.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Disciplinary Issues</h3><div>Despite what some Metropolitans would like to believe, they are neither infallible nor incorruptible. Legacy members have fabricated information or committed other offenses against their Houses. In cases in which punishment seems warranted, the Weavers use Time magic to find the likely consequences of different penalties. If the Weavers think a mage deserves a chance to reform, they choose the penalty most likely to teach the desired lesson, and least likely to breed bitter resentment.</div><div>Now and then, a House finds it must confine an erring member or an enemy. The Weavers ask the city itself where they could hold a magical criminal. Many cities have led a Metropolitan mage to a perfect space in which to create a small prison suitable for mages. The House of Ariadne does not usually want to serve as jailers for all Awakened: Metropolitans see the Silver Ladder filling that role, like it or not. The House takes care of its own, though, and deals with its own as well.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Guides to the Urban Labyrinth</h3><div>Not all geomancers \u2014 mages who follow the ley lines and Hallows \u2014belong to the House of Ariadne. However, any mage who studies geomancy and the teachings of Ariadne can learn to talk to the cities to discover their secrets. Many mages who do not join the House of Ariadne at least honor Ariadne\u2019s research and discoveries. Older mages who join the Metropolitans are often geomancers who find their studies can go no further without the Legacy\u2019s guidance. As long as cities exist, Metropolitans will be there to talk to the cities and teach other mages how to see Ariadne\u2019s thread.</div><div>The ability to see and follow Ariadne\u2019s thread is not a distinct spell; rather, it\u2019s a divinatory technique for a variety of Fate, Space and Time effects, either as a single Arcanum or in conjunction. For instance, a mage who seeks the current mayor\u2019s favorite childhood toy could define the resonant connection between person and toy using \u201cInterconnections\u201d (Fate 1), then start at the mayor\u2019s home and seek the toy\u2019s location using Space 2, walking until she finds the toy or gives up. Following the golden thread is an extended action, so a mage can accumulate successes to follow very weak sympathetic connections.</div><div>Much of the time, though, Metropolitans just cast blindly and trust Ariadne\u2019s thread to lead them somewhere interesting \u2014 relying on Fate 2 \u201cExtraordinary Luck\u201d to reveal something useful for the Legacy to know.</div>",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"The House\u2019s geomancy requires mastery of divination, but instead of focusing on a small item like a crystal or a pack of cards, Metropolitans use the expanse of the city to divine the past, present and future. The mage who wishes to follow Ariadne\u2019s thread must study Time and Fate. Much of the Metropolitans\u2019 powers come from walking a self-made Knot in the city. The House of Ariadne never takes the direct route.",firstAttainmentName:"Attune",firstAttainmentPrerequisites:"Gnosis 3, Time 2 (primary), Fate 1",firstAttainmentDescription:"<div>After seeing Ariadne\u2019s thread, the first step a mage must take is attuning himself to the city. He must initially spend six hours walking through the city, following Ariadne\u2019s thread. After this, he may use this attunement to feel the city\u2019s history. This resembles the Time 2 spell \u201cPostcognition.\u201d While the mage might not know names, he can tell if and when a man was murdered on this street corner, or if a couple made love in a park or if a mage committed a vulgar spell in a movie theater. A mage is not married to the city in which he Awakened. He can attune himself to any city he is in.</div><div>The symbolism of the city makes itself known to the mage, as the city\u2019s resonance applies different meanings to different things. (For example, a park\u2019s \u201cTunnel of Love\u201d may resonate happiness or sexual energy for most cities, but if a brutal murder happened there, the ride may resonate with fear, hatred and death.)

The whole process is actually a specialized, somewhat oblique use of \u201cDivination\u201d \u2014 but instead of seeking a clue about what another person will do in the future, the mage asks what path is most likely to lead him to his goal.</div><div>Following the thread of Fate may take some time, and if the mage seeks a kidnapped colleague, the mage has no guarantee the person won\u2019t be dead when the mage finds her.

If the target is kept behind considerable defenses, whether locked doors, vaults or magical protection, Ariadne\u2019s thread will not give the mage any abilities to bypass the security.

They want to create a path that the Awakened can travel more easily, at the end of which lies the Awakening of every man, woman and child on the planet.</div><div>The actual medium of the Pygmalians\u2019 Art is open \u2014 any art, high or low, can change things. The Sculptors are obsessed with finding a Holy Grail of true inspiration that will bring about history-changing art. Charles Dickens wrote a few works of fiction and ignited Western society\u2019s conscience toward the urban poor. Renaissance painters invented perspective drawing, and a mathematics of space that redefined the world. The writers and translators of the Bible changed the course of  human history many times over.</div><div>Art can be deadly, too. Leni Riefenstahl propagated the sinister glamour that made a nation complicit in the deaths of millions. China\u2019s official TV and newspapers have convinced the most populous nation in the world that the Tiananman Square massacre never happened, that stories of the massacre are just an American plot. Advertising agencies use art to relieve people of their money and leave them in perpetual discontent.</div><div>Change happens around the Pygmalians. They are not always the direct cause, but they\u2019re always there, nudging things along. People fall in love. Scientists find new insights into the nature of things. Revolutions begin, or end in blood and fire.</div><div>Whatever the Pygmalians do, they accept no barriers to their Art. With no boundaries, it\u2019s inevitable that some Sculptors go bad. These fallen Pygmalians don\u2019t confine their Art within moral limits. A Pygmalian might commit atrocities to effect the inspiration of a single individual. A Pygmalian\u2019s deeds can easily result in dozens of lives ruined or ended at a single stroke. Love ends more easily than it begins. Even the most noble of revolutions can descend into tyranny. These ruthless mages give the Pygmalian Society the bad reputation it currently suffers among the Awakened.</div><div>True Pygmalians are much more than the terrorists and instigators of chaos that other mages often believe the Sculptors to be. True Pygmalians are artists, and more than that: they think they know the means by which the entire human race can one day Awaken.</div>",alternateNickname:"Sculptors",orders:"All five of the great mystical orders have Pygmalian members, but more than half of them of the Sculptors end up in the Free Council (if they join an order at all). The first Pygmalians all belonged to the Free Council, and, although the Legacy is not intimately connected to the order, the line of tutor to pupil frequently ensures that new Pygmalians join the Free Council in turn, or belonged to the order in the first place. The Free Council is certainly the order that is most amenable to radical social and intellectual change as a means to Awaken humanity. The less-regulated Free Council is also the order most likely to accept a Pygmalian despite the Legacy\u2019s checkered reputation. <div>The four Atlantean orders all have a few Pygmalians. The Silver Ladder\u2019s stated aim for the Awakening of the human race attracts a fair number of Sculptors, but these mages often find themselves frustrated by the order\u2019s strict and convoluted hierarchy.</div><div>The Mysterium, with its emphasis on acquiring mystical knowledge, is fairly accommodating, since the Pygmalians are often expert at interpreting the past, connecting it to the present and suggesting implications for the future. Mundane and magical archeology can give the facts about what people did, but an artist\u2019s insight into human emotions can suggest why.</div><div>Of the old orders, the Guardians of the Veil and the Adamantine Arrow attract the fewest Sculptors. The Guardians don\u2019t generally tolerate the meddling of Pygmalians who try too hard to change human affairs; however, a few of the more subtle Sculptors do find a home among the Guardians. Meanwhile, the Arrows sometimes attract some of the more martially inclined Pygmalians. These Sculptors are respected by other mages within the order, but rarely trusted, and it\u2019s often these Pygmalians who fall into violence as a means of effecting change.</div>",appearance:"Like Sleeper artists, Pygmalians are as easy to recognize as they choose to be. Some follow clich\xe9s such as the Galois-smoking bohemian with his beret, straight from the Left Bank of Paris, or the intellectual sophisticate clad all in basic black. More Sculptors just look like ordinary, middle-class people. Their manner gives a truer guide. Whoever Sculptors might be, they speak and act passionately. Sometimes, they slide into melodrama that makes cooler-tempered people wince or shake their heads. Subtler mannerisms and an attention to details of the Sculptors\u2019 surroundings make Sleepers think the Sculptors ought to be artists, even if they wear exactly the same clothes as the people standing next to them.",background:"Every Pygmalian is an artist with a fair amount of talent and promise. This includes every possible expression of art: novelists, painters, poets, performance artists, musicians, architects, filmmakers, stand-up comedians and DJs are all represented among the Pygmalians. They are not necessarily professional artists. Occasionally, an individual who is not usually considered an artist \u2014 a mathematician, a software developer or even a soldier or a politician \u2014 joins the Legacy. As long as someone considers what she does to be an art, and is passionate about it, the person is eligible to join.<div>Pygmalians also know their art isn\u2019t enough. Their promise is unfulfilled, and they all want more. Most Pygmalians are just talented enough to realize that they\u2019re not quite talented enough to change the world through their chosen media. They can never reach the supreme heights attained by a Shakespeare, a Rembrandt or a Dante. The Pygmalians offer them an alternative through magic, the Ars Mysteriorum itself.</div>",organizzation:"The Pygmalian Society has little or no formal organization. Pygmalians have no central authority and recognize no precedence other than the respect due teachers from their pupils. Tutors and pupils seem to find each other without trying. Training can vary greatly in intensity and style. One tutor, for example, teaches two or three pupils at a time, holding regular and highly formal classes, where he imparts the mystical knowledge of the tradition in a theoretical, academic form and leaves his pupils to perfect the Legacy\u2019s attainments in their own time, as \u201chomework.\u201d Another tutor disappears from her pupil\u2019s life for weeks on end, turning up apparently according to whim. She spends a few days alongside her pupil, accompanying the less experienced mage through the beginning of each new stage, before vanishing again, leaving the pupil to work out what to do with his new knowledge on his own. Still another tutor demands that he move into his pupil\u2019s home, taking over his unfortunate apprentice\u2019s entire life in order to make a real Sculptor out of her.<div>Whatever the method, all Pygmalian tutors allow their pupils freedom in their choice of Art form (no matter what their personal opinions of its validity as a medium might be). Although it\u2019s common for a tutor to take a pupil who works on the same kind of Art, it\u2019s not universal.</div>",suggestedOblations:"Write a poem or short story by hand, let one person read it, then burn the manuscript.

The conflict seems unthinkable today, but was widely reported in the Parisian press at the time, since several well-known people of the day were involved. The factions in the \u201cWars\u201d were mostly composed of Sleepers. A few Awakened were also present, indulging their own schisms and conflicts under cover of the very public and, to them, trivial arguments of their unwitting Sleeper colleagues. </div><div>One of these mages was Patrice Cajean. Born penniless in Brittany in the late 1860s, Cajean Awakened as a teenager into a nightmare of swirling sounds and colors. By the end of the 1880s, Cajean, through a combination of charm, talent and Awakened magic, reinvented himself as a figure of urbanity and wit. He became a popular figure in the bohemian salons of fin de si\xe8cle Paris. </div><div>Through his powers, Cajean was no stranger to the formal mysticism of the Paris sects. He found himself drawn to one particular Rosicrucian splinter group. This group declared that Art was a great mystery, a great empire and a great miracle, and that Artists were hence the secret kings, priests and magicians of the world. Cajean wondered if there was something to this theory. Although he felt contempt for of the importance this faction attached to its petty squabbles, Cajean investigated the possibility that Art was in fact a small form of magic, a link between human beings and the Supernal World (which Cajean, inspired by Neoplatonist philosophy, identified as the Divine Principle, or the Godhead). He posited that when God said, \u201clet there be light,\u201d He created Art through pure inspiration, distilled into creation by an act of will. </div><div>Cajean investigated ways to harness this true, inspired creativity. He believed he could manipulate human history through Art, planting some ideas and stifling others to weaken the Lie. Just about everyone could appreciate some sort of Art; so Cajean believed he could Awaken everyone through this slender thread connecting their souls to the Supernal World. The project might take a century or more, but an Acanthus mage is not discouraged by time. </div><div>A few other mages thought Cajean had a good idea. Cajean pictured himself as a new Pygmalion, breathing life into the Fallen World\u2019s lifeless images of the True Forms, so he called his formal and highly ritualized cabal of like-minded mages the Pygmalian Society. His magical program for mass Awakening depended upon communication and control, on ascertaining the intricate web of connections between the soul and other souls, between the soul and the past, present and future. To the Legacy\u2019s existing skill at Fate and Time, the Legacy\u2019s founders added a deep study of Mind, in order to gain a precise knowledge of how the arts could manipulate thoughts and emotions. They had no real plan, though \u2014 just a deep faith in the transformative power of Art. </div><div>Cajean\u2019s first pupil, Marcus Naismith, was an Englishman. He brought the Pygmalian Society into the English-speaking world. Naismith\u2019s own take on the Legacy\u2019s magic was influenced by his great love of the philosophy and art of the visionary poet and engraver William Blake. English-speaking Pygmalians in particular have used Blakean language to describe their magic and rituals ever since. </div><div>A member of the Society last saw Patrice Cajean alive in March of 1916. Right up to the end of his life, Cajean felt the need to live among the ordinary people he longed to see reunited with the Godhead. He believed a Supernal inspiration brought the human race to the Great War: patriotic fervor and the need to prove the courage of nations led the entire world into a storm of death, plague and famine. Cajean knew the Great War would shatter the age of European colonial empires, with possibilities for great Good and terrifying Evil opening up through the rest of the century. The idealistic mage hoped to avert the horrors of the Great War and its aftermath, but could not stand to hide in a secure sanctum far from harm. He needed to share the danger and the struggle. Cajean failed; he died in the fighting at Verdun, wearing the face of a man 30 years his junior. </div><div>In the years after the Great War, the Pygmalian Society fragmented. Without Cajean\u2019s charisma to temper the remaining founders\u2019 personal quarrels, they drifted apart. Art was changing, too. New movements such as futurism, cubism, and Dada brought new ideas and new Pygmalians who had little time for a structured organization. They preferred to use the Legacy in their own way. By World War II, \u201cPygmalians\u201d had ceased to be anything more than a catch-all term for those mages who crafted their souls in the tradition of Patrice Cajean, and the Pygmalians have resisted formal organization ever since. Their methods and Art have changed, but they still hold true to Patrice Cajean\u2019s faith in the Supernal power of Art.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>The first principles of the Pygmalian Society grew out of Western occult traditions. Although most Pygmalians don\u2019t dress up their magic in the formal principles of Rosicrucian practice any more, the study of their attainments shows the influence of a very European style of mysticism, with a special nod to William Blake. They still use much of Patrice Cajean\u2019s language. Most Pygmalians still refer to the Supernal as the \u201cGodhead,\u201d for example; they call their goal of universal Awakening the \u201cReconciliation,\u201d or the \u201cMarriage of Heaven and Hell.\u201d</div><div>As a corollary, most Pygmalians practice European styles of creative Art. Awakened artists representing non-Western artistic forms (such as African woodcarving, for example, or Japanese verse) seldom find their way into the Pygmalian Society. If such artists-mages do get the opportunity to join, it\u2019s generally because they try to practice their art in a Western context; for example, a member of a group of Indian musicians performing in New York state art centers. </div><div>Apart from the relationship between tutors and their pupils, Pygmalians aren\u2019t known for working together. They don\u2019t hold to any network, and they don\u2019t recognize any obligations to each other above and beyond that normally expected because of membership in a cabal or a mystical order. </div><div>As Artists, the Pygmalians have more than their fair share of self-publicists in their number. They tend to become well known among the mystical orders, particularly among Consilii in Western Europe and in urbanized areas of the United States. Many more mages hear about Pygmalian mages than actually meet them. Unfortunately, the greatest self-publicists among the Pygmalians are often those who went wrong. Many mages who know about Pygmalians by reputation don\u2019t even realize that they\u2019re Artists, and imagine instead that they are a Legacy of terrorists or lunatics. </div><div>The wide variation among the methods and styles of the Pygmalians often means that this assessment goes unchallenged. Most Sculptors don\u2019t care in the end what other mages think. The nature of the Sculptors\u2019 goal is such that they care more about the Sleepers, anyway. </div><div>A Pygmalian mage surrounds herself with Sleepers \u2014 talented, passionate people who achieve more than simple talk, never art-school poseurs. She does her absolute level best to become a conduit of inspiration for the extraordinary people around her. At best, a Sculptor tries to drive her companions to create something special, something fantastic. It\u2019s not the mage\u2019s own role to change things. No great invention or epochmaking artwork has ever been made by a mage: it\u2019s the way that the Fallen World works. The Pygmalians recognize that this is the Sleepers\u2019 world, and the Sleepers have to change it. </div><div>The credit for great art never belongs to the Sculptor. All he does is attempt to contribute through magic and other arts to an environment where genius can flourish; creation can occur only through inspiration. Simply to give ideas to an artist is not enough. True genius can work with secondhand materials (you only need to look at the work of Shakespeare and Mozart to see that), but great artists transform their sources in unique, inspired ways. What the Sculptor tries to do is simply be there and guide his Artists to find the Godhead themselves. He\u2019s a lover, a companion, a patron, a friend, sometimes a rival or an enemy. Sometimes, loneliest of all, he\u2019s an unattainable figure in the distance that haunts his Artists\u2019 steps. Whatever role he takes, he\u2019s a muse and a catalyst for the real Artist and the real work. </div><div>The Pygmalian\u2019s goal is to create the conditions through which the Reconciliation can happen. Any incursion of magic, any minor half-Awakening is enough. It doesn\u2019t matter if there isn\u2019t a specific plan as such. If enough of these small victories are won, the mages of the Pygmalian Society are confident that, one day, the Marriage of Heaven and Hell will take place and everyone will Awaken.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Tygers of Wrath Are Wiser Than the Horses of Instruction</h3><div>Art is a dangerous thing. The Pygmalian Society recognizes this, but, at the same time, the Legacy\u2019s lack of organization means that the group has no checks and balances. The freedom of its members to find any way at all to create art can become a trap of Hubris. While fallen Pygmalians have been few, a Sculptor gone wrong can have a terrible influence on the world around her. </div><div>These fallen Sculptors are Jonahs. Chaos surrounds them. When they\u2019re nearby, relationships collapse. Families tear apart. Cars crash. Crops fail. Diseases break out. Buildings explode. Riots erupt. Governments lose their grip. Wars start. People die. </div><div>The most notorious of these Sculptors was Enoch Christopher, a Welsh poet who joined the Pygmalian Society in 1936. Christopher, influenced by the futurists, composed puzzling non-linear works that, thanks to his mastery of Pygmalian magic, held his manifesto encoded within them: true inspiration requires conflict. Anger, grief and terror open artists to Supernal truth and goad them to the heights of self-expression. Christopher believed that if his Art was to have any chance of bringing about real transformation, the Art had to be unfettered by any limits of scale or morality. </div><div>This manifesto of change through violence has cropped up, quite independently, on a number of occasions. These Pygmalians might not openly say so to begin with, but they share the assumption that human beings are just raw clay for the Sculptor\u2019s Art. Some Sculptors begin to directly manipulate lives. The more powerful among them tear up human memories and put them back together like a Burroughsian cut-up, using trauma to drive their victims to action. </div><div>Some Pygmalians become equally cavalier with themselves. They alter their own minds, messing with everything from taste in clothes right through to sexual orientation, even temporarily rebuilding their own memories in order to become their grand Artwork and, through the inspiration they gain, alter the world. It\u2019s not healthy to become close to Pygmalians who works like this. Everything goes wrong around them, as they engineer conflict in their own lives. They manipulate people around them to create lovers, enemies, tragedies, accidents and obstacles to overcome \u2014 often without even informing themselves that they\u2019re doing it. For instance, a Sculptor creates an alternate personality to fall in love, then the master personality kills the lover so the other self can experience true loss. </div><div>Enoch Christopher himself died in the late 1980s, a notorious harbinger of disaster. He had become possibly the best-known Pygmalian who had ever lived, almost singlehandedly responsible for the Pygmalian Society\u2019s bad name. The original manuscript copy of Christopher\u2019s 1939 collection of \u201cautomatic poetry,\u201d When I Came Back It Was Gone, still exists and is a powerful, spontaneously generated Artifact in its own right. The revisions and alterations contained in this sheaf of yellowing paper hold frightening secrets and great power along with cold, brutal resonance.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>The Pygmalian Society sets few requirements for its members. Pygmalians are Awakened and Artists. All have that desire, that need, to make a powerful difference to creation. </div><div>The Pygmalians have no hard rules for choosing their pupils. Some Pygmalians seek particular individuals; others wait for pupils to come to them. Time seems to play tricks on new Pygmalians, and many even experience their first initiation before deciding to join the order, or even knowing that they\u2019re being initiated \u2014 which is just as well, since, given the Legacy\u2019s terrible reputation, very few mages would actually join without some kind of revelation as to what the Pygmalian Society really is.</div><div>In his induction, the mage enters a deep coma. Initiation plays out as a hyper-real dream in which the mage, placed in the surroundings of his mind\u2019s eye, is forced to undergo an ordeal of some kind. Ordeals vary, but they are always deadly serious, and sometimes just deadly: the new Pygmalian might have to endure what seems like a week-long ritual dance, survive a crucifixion or experience being tattooed all over his body. In the ordeal, the Pygmalian is guided or hindered (or both) by a visionary figure who will return in each of the Pygmalian\u2019s initiatory ordeals. Sometimes, this figure is a mirror image of the Pygmalian, a past self or a potential future self. Sometimes, the guide is a sexual complement of the Pygmalian, a perfect \u201cother half\u201d of the opposite gender to the initiate (or, if the initiate is gay, the same gender). Sometimes, the guide is an entirely different figure, perhaps one of the regular cast of the initiate\u2019s dreams elevated to the position of spokesperson. Sometimes, the guide is a mythical or literary figure: anything from a Grail-questing knight to a talking animal that leads the mage down a rabbit hole.</div><div>When the ordeal is over, the Pygmalian returns to consciousness and the real world. There is always some anomaly that suggests that the ordeal was not a dream. A Pygmalian who endures being tattooed wakes up with a small tattoo on her face. A Pygmalian who endures crucifixion in his vision wakes up with small scars on his hands, feet and sides. Another Pygmalian finds small objects or items of jewellery belonging to her mage\u2019s guide in her pockets. On the other hand, a Pygmalian who fails his initiation usually has no memory of what happened, and is likely to be found very ill, or with broken bones or just covered from head-to-toe with bruises or superficial burns.</div><div>Although every Pygmalian tutor teaches his pupils in his own way, the substance of the teaching is fairly constant: pupils are taught the Pygmalian philosophy of Art. At the same time, Pygmalian pupils receive absolute freedom with what they do with the teaching, how they express their Art and whom they choose to guide in turn. </div><div>In each subsequent initiation, the Pygmalian undergoes another hallucinatory ordeal, and, each time, gains another sign that the ordeal was more than simply a dream. These dream-ordeals, however, are not spontaneous unless the Sculptor has cut her tie to her tutor and decided to craft her soul without further help. Soulcrafting for the second and third attainments involves a preparatory ritual. Each tutor and pupil design a unique ritual to induce the initiatory vision, but the ceremony uses paraphernalia drawn from Western magical traditions. Depending on the tutor, this could involve robes or nakedness, magic circles, wands, knives and the like.</div><div>Shortly before Cajean\u2019s death, he underwent a fourth ordeal. He told one of his pupils that he had learned the truth about where these visions came from and who the visionary figures really are. He died before he could lead anyone else to the fourth attainment. If any other Pygmalians have reached the fourth ordeal by themselves, they\u2019ve kept quiet about what they learned.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Induction Before Choice</h3><div>Many Pygmalians say they had their initiatory ordeal before they decided to join the Legacy, and their initiatory ordeal guided them to their tutors. That\u2019s only partly accurate: Acanthus mages take a free and easy view of Time, but even they don\u2019t engage in rampant causality violation.</div><div>Unconsciously, an Acanthus mage\u2019s soul can see the possible futures and the option of joining the Pygmalians. The soul induces the initiatory coma; mind and soul have their dialogue and reach a conclusion. The soulcrafting is not complete, however. Unless the nascent Pygmalian has a Gnosis of 4 or higher, he still needs a tutor\u2019s help to \u201clock in\u201d his soul\u2019s new shape.</div>",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"<div>Pygmalians seek to make a tangible, material alteration to history through their Art. Many mages are surprised that the powers the Pygmalians cultivate above all others are so indirect.

Through this Arcanum, they manipulate emotion, sense and memory for the purpose of guiding others to their own inspiration. </div><div>Pygmalian magic is subtle, hidden in passionate words or flamboyant gestures that are not obviously magical in and of themselves. Many Pygmalians, particularly those who perform in some way, learn how to use their Art as a vehicle for their magic (especially for extended spellcasting).

Smells, sounds, tastes and colors \u2014 or their implanted memories \u2014 can alter someone\u2019s mood for good or ill, reminding a subject or a group of people of whatever emotion the mage wants them to experience. This attainment produces an effect more or less identical to the Mind 2 rote \u201cSculpt the Heart\u201d (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 208), but using a contested roll of Manipulation + Expression + Mind versus the subject\u2019s Composure + Gnosis.</div><div>The mage\u2019s own senses are affected too. By examining the sensory reflection of the emotions dredged up from his subjects\u2019 memories, the mage can perceive the weave of connections existing between the people he affects and the people around them. The links of emotion and Fate manifest as a kind of synesthesia, with emotional smells, tastes, sounds or colors becoming apparent to the mage as he examines the web of association around him. In game terms, this works as the Fate 1 spell \u201cInterconnections\u201d (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 148). As a minor side effect, the mage permanently becomes a synesthete, with tastes, colors, smells and sounds mixed up in his perceptions. Many Pygmalians see this as a benefit, citing Shakespeare and Kandinsky as examples of inspiration through synesthesia.</div><div>The mage can bring about the memory of feeling through simple conversation, or through the medium of his Art (for example, by means of a musical performance, a stand-up gig or a gallery showing at which the mage is present). The effect does not always have to be direct. Calming words can, for example, be used to hide an infuriating subtext (in the manner of a \u201cfriends, Romans, countrymen\u201d speech).</div><div>If they can, Pygmalians use this power on groups of people rather than individuals, since the more people the Pygmalians can affect, the more information they can glean about their interconnections.</div><div>Sometimes, a Pygmalian uses this power on herself. She might feel she needs to force herself to do something frightening or emotionally painful. She might want to make herself play a role with true sincerity, or she could simply want to feel something. Even though the mage uses this power on a willing subject (i.e., herself), she still makes a reflexive roll of Composure + Gnosis to resist; the mage might be willing, but, subconsciously, her soul perceives this as an intrusion and fights back. The mage can, however, reduce her resistance dice pool by spending Mana, thus suppressing her natural reactions with magical brute force: each point of Mana spent reduces the Composure + Gnosis pool by 1.</div>",firstAttainmentOptArcana:"",firstAttainmentOptDescrizione:"",secondAttainmentName:"Arrows of Desire ",secondAttainmentPrerequisites:"Gnosis 5, Mind 3",secondAttainmentDescription:"<div>The Pygmalians develop their understanding of sensory and emotional manipulation further by learning how to imbue their actions or their performances with complex meaning. This works in a manner similar to the Mind 3 rote \u201cBricks of Babel\u201d (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 213), but using a roll of Intelligence + Expression + Mind. Pygmalians who achieve this second attainment can communicate complex concepts and messages in a few brief, insignificant movements, or say one thing and communicate something completely different to the recipient. The mage can choose whether to communicate his message to an individual or to a group (use the modifiers for casting spells on more than one target; see Mage: The Awakening p. 118); the mage can also choose whether the recipients of the message actually realize that they\u2019ve received a message from him, rather than simply having thoughts pop into their heads.</div><div>The second attainment can be used in conjunction with the first.

Through the manipulation of memory, a mage with this attainment can make a single subject experience an epiphany, a sudden understanding of some past event, or a false memory of some inspirational, life-changing experience. Depending on the event the mage chooses, this experience can be healing or traumatic. In game terms, this works like the Mind 4 spell \u201cBreach the Vault of Memory\u201d (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 214) with the same contested roll of Gnosis + Mind versus the subject\u2019s Resolve + Gnosis. </div><div>The revelation doesn\u2019t last very long (usually no more than a scene \u2014 see the spell description in Mage: The Awakening, then apply the number of successes rolled to the Extended Spellcasting Duration chart for prolonged spells on p. 120 of that book), but the revelation\u2019s indirect effects last. Even when the subject recognizes that her memories of love, divine revelation or childhood trauma were delusions, she still recalls what it felt like to remember these things. The memory of feeling is not feeling, but often is enough to drive a creative individual to cathartic action. A novelist given a taste of bitter love writes a powerful story of loss and desire. A painter is driven to a masterpiece by the memory of a unique face.</div><div>Pygmalians often bolster the effect, repeating it or prolonging it with the use of the first and second attainments.

Similar to the first attainment, a Pygmalian using this power on himself still has to make a reflexive resistance roll, this time Resolve + Gnosis (per \u201cBreach the Vault of Memory\u201d). He can spend Mana to force the power on himself. Pygmalians using this power often have no idea what they\u2019re doing when under their own influence.

For the Scions of God, however, the fakery isn\u2019t fake. Their eerie and elaborate masks and costumes evoke a divine power that makes them more than human.</div><div>All mages know their souls have touched the Supernal World and yearn for that realm as their true home. The human ego, on the other hand, is a creature of the Astral Plane. But what of the Shadow Realm? Mages can visit the spirit plane through magic, but humans are not truly at home there. The Scions of God believe this omission helps lock humans into the Fallen World. Humans can ascend from the material plane more easily, the Scions of God say, if the humans exist in all four worlds at once: physical body, Supernal soul, Astral mind and ephemeral spirit. The Scions of God call this fourth entity the Holy Guardian Angel and try to make it the vehicle for both mind and soul.</div><div>The Legacy began during the Age of Exploration, when Europe\u2019s willworkers encountered African, Asian and Native American mages. The natives used masks to become vessels for gods and spirits: the Sleepers only in play-acting, the mages in truth. Even in the tribal dances and superstitious rites of the Sleepers, however, the explorers felt the breath of the Supernal World. They realized that some masks don\u2019t conceal the truth, they reveal it.</div><div>When the explorers returned home, a few mages tried using masks and costumes for their own ends. Their experiments gave some Silver Ladder mages new ideas about spirit-dealings and their own souls. The mage who first used masks to craft his own soul used the jargon of Kabbalism, so he called his divine persona his Holy Guardian Angel. His followers took the name of an order of angels, the Bene Elohim. The new Legacy eventually spread beyond Europe and absorbed elements from Hinduism, voodoo and other religions. As the Bene Elohim became more multicultural, members preferred to use its vulgate name, the Sons of God. During the 20th century, the Legacy changed its name to the gender-neutral Scions of God. Not only did the Legacy include as many women as men, but some members that found their Holy Guardian Angels apparently had different genders from themselves.</div><div>The Legacy\u2019s goals and methods, however, have not changed much. Scions of God conduct rituals of worship in costumes that show how they see their Holy Guardian Angels \u2014 the transcendent selves the Scions want to be. Hieraticrobes speak of priestly power, though Scions are priests of no Sleeper faith. A mask suggests a more than human essence: priest and god in the same person. Even when a Scion doesn\u2019t wear this costume, her nimbus manifests its appearance whenever she performs vulgar magic. In the Shadow Realm, a Scion always looks like her mask \u2014 but real and alive.</div><div>Scions of God want to purge themselves of human weakness and become incarnate angels, true spirits of the Supernal World. Some Scions hope that when they die, their fortified and tempered souls can Ascend to the Supernal World, to join the war against the Exarchs. Other Scions seek to become lords among spirits. While living, the Scions serve as gatekeepers between the worlds, expelling unruly spirits but encouraging spirits friendly to humanity. Other mages appreciate the Scions\u2019 power to locate and command spirits.\u2028Like the other members of the Silver Ladder, the Scions want to give Creation a righteous order. For the Masquers, this includes greater contact between mortals and spirits. The Masquers hope that Sleepers who experience the supernatural may become Sleepwalkers, or even Awaken, and come to understand their Supernal birthright. Scions tell the spirits that they, too, are trapped in a Fallen World and denied contact with a greater reality. The Scions dream of building an army of spirits and mortals to storm across the Abyss and throw down the false gods. This may take a thousand years, but it shall be done.</div>",alternateNickname:"Bene Elohim or Masquers",orders:"The Scions of God formed within the Silver Ladder; many Scions consider themselves shining exemplars of their order\u2019s ideals. In return, other members of the Silver Ladder respect the Scions\u2019 superb rapport with the Shadow Realm, even if their methods seem odd and flamboyant. Adamantine Arrow mages like to have a Masquer join them on forays into the Shadow Realm, while the Mysterium values the Scions\u2019 inside view of the spirit courts. Guardians of the Veil, however, often wince at the Masquers\u2019 willingness to use Spirit magic in front of Sleepers. Free Council mages used to think the Bene Elohim were just kooks playing dress-up; in return, Scions thought Free Council mages lacked moral gravity and respect for tradition. However, new Sleeper ideas about transhumanism prompt the Council to give the Scions another look. A few Council mages try to update and adapt Scion methods. These Free Council mages hope to become immortal spirits, using virtual reality simulations and digital avatars instead of masks and robes \u2014 and perhaps someday they shall succeed.",appearance:"Scions of God wear elaborate \u201cworking costumes\u201d when they assert their identities as divine spirits. A Scion\u2019s hieratic garb usually includes a sleeved cloak with embroidered bands around the hems, flaring collars (maybe more than one) and a large amulet as a clasp, a headdress of some sort and a sash around the waist. Some Scions stick to the scholar\u2019s gown of the medieval magician, a priest\u2019s cassock or the robe of an Egyptian priest. Other Scions wear a loose, comfortable shirt and trousers, or a blouse and skirt, but often they emblazon these garments with symbolic designs.<div>The mask, however, is the Legacy\u2019s defining accoutrement. More traditional Scions wear the stylized faces of lions, bulls, eagles, serpents or other animals with mythic associations \u2014 something Scion believe express the true faces of their souls. A Scion\u2019s mask may look quite different, though. Scion masks range from the beautiful human faces members would like to show the world to highly abstract masks with no human features at all. Members of the Legacy who possess only their first attainment line their cloaks with sky-blue silk. Second-degree Scions use a white lining. Masquers who achieve the third attainment wear gold. Scions may embroider their ceremonial garb with other signs indicating mastery of particular Arcana or other achievements, but such symbols are traditional for mages in general (and the Silver Ladder in particular), and not mandatory for any Masquer.</div>",background:"The sheer megalomania of the Scions\u2019 goal attracts mages of great ambition (Pride is a common Vice) or great dissatisfaction with themselves.

The Legacy is sufficiently small that the personal authority of its senior members suffices to organize meetings and resolve disputes, without the need for any special titles or offices. Most Scions operate apart from other Masquers, and freely join cabals with other mages. A Scion visits her tutor whenever she needs advice or training, and tutors are as likely as other mentors to demand assistance from their students, but the Legacy doesn\u2019t insist they associate at other times.<div>The Scions do not grant titles for their first or second attainments.

When Europe\u2019s great Age of Exploration began during the 15th century, anthropologically-minded mages in the Silver Ladder and Mysterium became particularly active in this respect.</div><div>Padre Matteo Lorca, known to the Sleepers as a Franciscan missionary to India, became the first European mage to study mask-magic in depth. Late in the 17th century, Lorca used his knowledge of Indian exorcist masks to banish a cholera-demon that had already slain two other mages. Lorca\u2019s success inspired several other mages to investigate the magical and ceremonial uses of masks.</div><div>Lorca\u2019s own apprentice Rios Barjuan, a.k.a. Adriel, tried using masks to summon angels. He hoped that, just as an ordinary mask could make a Sleeper feel he was a vessel for a god or spirit, an enchanted mask could help a mage commune with an angel. Adriel did not seek one of the shining but limited \u201cangels\u201d found in the Shadow Realm: he sought to call one of the glorious, enigmatic spirits occasionally reported by awestruck mages \u2014 spirits who seemed to ignore all the rules of the Shadow Realm and have no known habitation, whose terrible power surely marked them as emissaries of the Supernal. Adriel failed and the putative True Angels remain legendary to this day. Barjuan did not consider his research wasted, though. Along the way, Adriel discovered how to combine masks with certain Kabbalist theories of the soul and initiatory rites to develop a new method of soulcrafting. He could not summon an angel, but perhaps he could become one.</div><div>Adriel became one of the Silver Ladder\u2019s top exorcists. The order\u2019s chronicles credit him with destroying a nest of spirits corrupted and enthralled by an Abyssal horror. He also reformed (or transformed) the war-devil Sergulath back into one of the lower sort of angels; this martial spirit now guards one of the Silver Ladder\u2019s largest sanctums in Europe. Adriel\u2019s power attracted disciples who eventually grew into a recognized Legacy, the Bene Elohim.</div><div>Adriel\u2019s Legacy remained small until the 19th century. A revival of interest in Kabbalism among Sleeper occultists led to, or was caused by, greater interest in this tradition by the Awakened \u2014 as usual, historically-minded mages argue over who influenced whom. The 19th century also saw mages in India, China and other lands copying the Bene Elohim soulcrafting, without the elements of Judeo-Christian mysticism. Since dialogue with these foreign mages helped refine the Legacy\u2019s methods, increasing numbers of Bene Elohim thought it was only good manners to downplay the use of Hebrew.</div><div>The Sons of God suddenly came into prominence during World War I. As the Great War ground on and became more bitter, some cabals of mages took sides \u2014 and tried to draw their own spiritual allies into the conflict. The Great War almost spilled into the Shadow Realm, with what consequences no one could guess. The masters of the Legacy forbade this spiritual escalation. Around the world, Bene Elohim forced peace between the spirits of different magical factions and separated militaristic mages from their spirit allies. The Masquers made powerful enemies during those years, but gained great respect from many mages in the Silver Ladder and the Guardians of the Veil.</div><div>The Bene Elohim, now Scions of God, remain one of the smaller Legacies associated with the Silver Ladder. The Legacy\u2019s leaders have not issued any recent declarations to their colleagues in magic, or intervened in any Sleeper conflicts. The Scions of God seem content to act as individuals, each Scion mediating between Sleepers and spirits in her own way. The Scions have some common interests, but no common goal. </div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>The Masquers believe in a Supreme Being \u2014 Yahweh, Brahman, the name doesn\u2019t matter \u2014 who fashioned all the worlds and the spirits within them. The Scions do not doubt the existence of Atlantis, but wonder how well modern mages really understand the mythic fount of magic. Like the Garden of Eden, they say, Atlantis serves as a myth for the ruin of a divine, primal order.</div><div>In the beginning, the Scions say, humans knew their own divinity as children of the Creator and experienced the Shadow Realm as freely as the material world. When the Exarchs broke reality, they also broke mortals\u2019 connection to the Shadow Realm. The Scions say their masked rituals and meditations draw the mind and soul closer together as a single, divine self, with the Holy Guardian Angel to bind them together. The masks and costumes create an Imago for this spiritual body; the prayers and rituals in the oratory help the soul charge that Imago with spiritual power. The soulcrafting process cements the union. Each attainment marks a stronger bond between mind, spirit and soul.</div><div>A closer union between mind, soul and spiritual self does more than create a mage better able to work in the spirit world. A close union re-creates an entity that can cross the Abyss and carry the soul home \u2014 an entity a lot more powerful than the Exarchs usually encounter. The united soul becomes an angel, or even a god (as the Fallen World knows gods, at least). What\u2019s more, every united soul draws the material, spiritual and Supernal worlds a little closer together. The Masquers say that healing the Abyss and restoring humanity to its Supernal birthright obviously must take precedence over the petty distractions of the Fallen World. </div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Laws of Angels</h3><div>The Bene Elohim list politics and administration among those distractions, and so the Masquers avoid the elaborate grades, hierarchies and bylaws found in many Awakened societies. The Scions restrict their bylaws to a few pages of guidelines about what contact between mortals and spirits causes harm and what the Scions should encourage. In brief, the Scions approve of spirits that help humans and bend their minds toward Supernal matters. The Scions don\u2019t like spirits that harm or exploit humans, or that encourage sordid, worldly appetites. Some demons and devils deserve pity, though a Scion still must defeat them: these spirits cannot help their fallen state. Abyssal spirits such as the acamoth, however, must be fought without mercy.</div><div>The Scions adopt a similar policy with regard to non\u2013Scion mages. The Scions say that right is right and wrong is wrong, and anyone who\u2019s honest with himself knows the difference. Mages who use their powers for bad purposes must be stopped. Mages who consciously choose evil, such as the Scelesti, must be stopped hard. Scions of high Wisdom avoid obnoxious priggery by placing people above abstract principles. After all, every Sleeper is an angelic soul not yet Awakened to its true nature. Sleepers\u2019 lives and enlightenment matter more than the letter of any law. Masquers sometimes annoy more pragmatic mages with the Scions\u2019 refusal to compromise their high-flown ideals, but Scions with high Wisdom often win respect for their moral clarity and altruistic courage.</div><div>Scions can fall to Hubris just like any other mage, though. Holiness becomes holier-than-thou arrogance and contempt for anyone who doesn\u2019t defer to the Scions\u2019 \u201cangelic\u201d moral purity. When other mages express doubts about the ethics of a Scion\u2019s actions, a Hubris-riddled Scion often claims to serve \u201ca greater good beyond your sight.\u201d After all, when you know you\u2019re an angel on a mission from God, any decision you make must be correct.</div><div>Scions treat each other with great formality when they meet. After ritual phrases of greeting, the Scions list their attainments (if not obvious from their cloaks), Paths and tutors\u2019 names. Bene Elohim can loosen up with other mages they know well, but, when there\u2019s magic to be done, the Scions become utterly formal once more. Wielding divine power is serious business.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Angels of Ascension</h3><div>The Bene Elohim keep few secrets. Their doctrines and descriptions of their rituals are freely available, at least to other members of the Silver Ladder. (Their rotes are another matter: the Scions are no more ready than any other mages to give away rotes they invented.) Indeed, many Scions welcome a chance to talk about something other mages might keep a dark secret.</div><div>Death is not always the end for Scions who reach the third attainment. Archangels often become spirits after their corporeal death: the Holy Guardian Angel sheds the material body, and carries the mage\u2019s intact ego into the Shadow Realm. A Scion\u2019s personality simplifies when he becomes a spirit, but Bene Elohim don\u2019t suffer the mad obsessions that afflict ghost-mages. The Legacy\u2019s deceased members remain actively involved with their living colleagues; some dead mages continue as mentors to junior Scions (though such mages cannot soulcraft and death still breaks the mystical bond between tutor and pupil). Deceased Archangels sometimes attend Conventicles. They often join spirit courts, or even run their own. When an Archangel doesn\u2019t become a spirit after death, the other Scions presume she immediately ascended to carry the fight to the Exarchs. The Bene Elohim point to their deceased-but-still-active membership as evidence that the Scions know the true path to Ascension. </div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Light to the Shadow Realm</h3><div>The Scions of God believe their status as Supernal entities makes them stewards of the Shadow Realm as well as the human world. Stewardship means more than mastery. In the beginning, the Scions say, all spirits were good. The division of the worlds deformed the spirits, until some became demons of horror. Even the worst devil of the Shadow Realm, however, can be redeemed through Supernal intervention \u2014 namely, sufficiently powerful Spirit magic. Great Scions, such as their founder Adriel, have, indeed, turned hostile spirits into friends of humanity.</div><div>The Scions want more interaction between Sleepers and spirits, but this must take place in the right manner. Silver Ladder mages espouse competing visions of what \u201cthe right manner\u201d means, so the Masquers do as well; but they agree that a proper relationship between mortals and spirits benefits both sides. The Sleepers don\u2019t always know about this, but the Scions look for Sleepers who might accept the truth (or something close to it). Sleepers willing to believe in a spirit world might be readier to believe in a Supernal World as well and want to regain their place in it.</div><div>Scions rarely approve of outright slavery for spirits. The Legacy\u2019s traditions say that slavery is wrong no matter who is the master and who is the slave. Masquers allow permanent bindings, however, if all parties take them willingly. Thus, Scions may grant spirit familiars to other mages (or even mortals) or tether spirits to locations as their guardians and caretakers. The spirits always give informed consent \u2014 but the Scions\u2019 second attainment can make a spirit agree to a permanent binding. As long as the commands did not involve the use of Intimidation, most Scions say they didn\u2019t force the spirits\u2019 wills: the Scions were just very persuasive, and the spirits responded to the Supernal righteousness of the Holy Guardian Angel. But that slippery slope easily leads to Hubris.</div><div>As the Scions of God gain power, they become frequent visitors to the spirit courts. Masquers often represent human interests to the spirits or serve as diplomats between spirit courts. As mortals (or former mortals), Scions have more flexible minds than the spirits, and the wiser spirit-lords value this quality. Bene Elohim often acquire spirits as Allies, Contacts and Mentors, not just familiars. Even if a Scion joins a court, however, the Masquer never pledges unconditional fealty to a spirit. The Scion serves as an allied but independent contractor or advisor, who can cancel his pact if he accepts the penalties agreed upon beforehand. Supernal creatures must not abase themselves to lower entities.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>The Scions of God accept applicants without regard to their Path. Applicants must be members of the Silver Ladder in good standing, though, and with no major scandals in their past. A would-be Masquer begins by asking an existing member to act as his sponsor to the Legacy\u2019s master mages. Three senior Scions question the applicant and examine his past for crimes or dangerous entanglements with other groups, whether mortal or supernatural: the Bene Elohim do not want to grant their power to mages who might misuse the power in service to demons, the Exarchs or even fouler entities. Since an experienced Masquer collects many contacts in the spirit world, including spirits of knowledge and divination, the Legacy can perform quite a thorough background check. If the three examiners agree the applicant seems sincere and competent to follow the Legacy\u2019s training, the applicant\u2019s sponsor (or another Scion) can become the mage\u2019s tutor.</div><div>A mage does not become a Scion quickly. First, a would-be Scion must build her oratory; she furnishes it with an altar, lamp and censer. The aspirant decorates the oratory to look like her vision of her Path\u2019s Watchtower and remind her of her Holy Guardian Angel\u2019s image. For instance, an Obrimos aspirant who sees her spiritual self as an angelic seraph (Hebrew for \u201cFiery Serpent\u201d) would drape her oratory with scarlet silk embroidered with golden lightning-bolts and serpents, while a Moros who sees his Holy Guardian Angel as an Egyptian death-god such as Seker might make his oratory look like an Egyptian tomb. A door and windows open on a patio where the mage can receive spirits. Nearby is a spartan chamber for reading, eating and sleeping. The aspiring Scion studies folklore, occult texts and religious art to inspire her imagination about the form of her Holy Guardian Angel. Through long meditation, the applicant queries her own soul about the form her spiritual self should take. The initiation cannot begin until both aspirant and tutor are sure they know the Holy Guardian Angel\u2019s appearance, and fashion the candidate\u2019s ceremonial mask and costume.</div><div>The initiation lasts 40 days. The aspirant spends hours each day in her oratory, praying to the Highest in the name of her Holy Guardian Angel and imagining herself in the form shown by her mask and costume. The would-be Scion fasts during the day and eats sparingly in the evening.</div><div>Most importantly, the aspirant uses Spirit 2 \u201cPeer Across the Gauntlet\u201d (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 247) every waking moment, first in his oratory and then out in the world. He must gain the habit of seeing the Shadow Realm as much a part of his surroundings as the material world, if not more so. That\u2019s the view he\u2019ll have once he gains his first attainment, so a Scion had better be sure he wants it. The Shadow Realm is not always pleasant to see.</div><div>The aspirant spends the last day alone with her tutor. She begins her prayer and meditation at dawn. At noon, she kneels at her altar. The tutor infuses her with a point of Mana as a sacrament before linking their souls. In this visionary experience, the aspirant sees her Holy Guardian Angel in the form she has decided, and steps within it. It is not a part of her; she is part of it. From then on, she is a Scion of God, an angel who walks the Fallen World. Afterward, her tutor presents the new Scion to her examiners, who confirm her in the Legacy.</div><div>Subsequent initiations to the second and third attainments also take place in a Scion\u2019s oratory and require many hours of meditation, prayer and rituals to purify the Masquer and assert his identity with his Holy Guardian Angel. The rites themselves have no special requirements. The third attainment is a big event with the Legacy, however, and other Archangels \u2014 living and dead \u2014 often wait to honor the Scion and welcome him to their company.</div><div>Many Scions believe that death and transition to a fully spiritual existence form their Legacy\u2019s fourth attainment. After a Scion\u2019s corporeal death and cremation, other members of the Legacy gather to deconsecrate and dismantle her oratory. A place that has seen so much traffic between worlds leaves a weak spot in the Gauntlet that hostile spirits might use to invade the material world. Destroying the oratory solves these potential problems. </div><div>Everything intimately connected to the dead Scion must be destroyed as well. Such relics could fetter a deceased Masquer to the world, turning him into an insane ghost-mage instead of becoming a spirit noble or Ascending to the Supernal World. Destroying relics also prevents enemy mages from gaining power over former Scions.</div>",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"The special attainments of the Bene Elohim help them interact more easily with the spirit world, as if they were spirits themselves.",firstAttainmentName:"Angelic Sight",firstAttainmentPrerequisites:"Gnosis 3, Space 1, Spirit 2 (primary), Occult 2",firstAttainmentDescription:"<div>The first stage in becoming a spirit is learning to see the Shadow Realm all the time, unless the Masquer consciously chooses to ignore the local spirits.

A Masquer, however, is not restricted to Presence + Intimidation + Spirit for his dice pool. He can use whatever Attribute + Ability pairing best suits his circumstances and personal aptitudes, just as dealing with people. An imperious command suits most spirits, especially when exorcising a hostile spirit from someone\u2019s home. Now and then, though, a Scion may prefer a softer approach to play on a spirit\u2019s personality quirks (Manipulation + Subterfuge), flatter the spirit (Manipulation + Persuasion) or even seduce the spirit (Presence + Socialize) before applying the Scion\u2019s magical will.

For instance, if a Masquer recognized that a demon recently influenced a person to commit some heinous act, the Scion could command the demon to appear through its link to its victim. The Storyteller decides the strength and duration of the sympathetic tie based on the extent and intimacy of the contact. For instance, a spirit\u2019s current fetter has an Intimate connection, as would a mortal who mortgaged his soul to a demon. An abandoned fetter or a single use of a spirit\u2019s power on a person creates a Known level of contact for a week, after which the connection degrades to Acquainted for the next month, before dropping to Encountered from then on. Repeated contact between a spirit and a mortal could strengthen the connection to Intimate, perhaps for a long time afterwards.</div><div>Some spirits may be called or influenced using special names or sigils.

He may affect any spirit in Twilight or near him in the Shadow Realm, with any of his physical abilities because he exists in both worlds. Conversely, a Scion in the Shadow Realm could reach across the Gauntlet to affect people and objects in the physical world. Reaching into the other world does not require any sort of dice roll. Any particular action might, though, and can suffer a penalty for Gauntlet Strength. For example, if a Scion wanted to punch an elemental across a Strength 5 Gauntlet, the player would roll Strength + Brawling + Spirit \u2013 the spirit\u2019s Defense, at a further \u20133 penalty for the Gauntlet\u2019s Strength.</div><div>When a Scion uses Hand of the Elohim, whatever part of her that crosses into another zone of reality appears in the form the Scion imagines for her Holy Guardian Angel. For example, a Scion who imagines her spiritual self as a robed eagle-woman would manifest her hand with raptor\u2019s talons in the Shadow Realm \u2014 or in the material world, if she stood on the other side of the Gauntlet. While in Twilight, she could manifest her entire spiritual form to those in the Fallen World, as if she were a materialized spirit. Since she uses an attainment rather than a spell, such a manifestation does not provoke Paradox (though the Sleeper might still Disbelieve afterward). Indeed, such a manifestation (especially when augmented with \u201cCelestial Fire\u201d \u2014 see below) may shock a Sleeper into belief in magic, becoming a Sleepwalker. On a few occasions, sight of a Scion\u2019s angelic form actually sparked Awakenings.</div>",thirdAttainmentOptArcana:"Prime 4",thirdAttainmentOptDescrizione:"<div>An Archangel who has Prime 4 can use Essence interchangeably with Mana, without the need for a spell or rote, as if he were a spirit himself.</div><div>Note that an Archangel with Prime 3 can feed a point of Mana to infuse his nimbus with \u201cCelestial Fire,\u201d per the Prime 3 spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 224).

They rode over the waves of the sea like the reflection of the moon on the water and flew through the night sky, free of their mortal weight.</div><div>The Sodality of the Tor understands the Mystery behind these beliefs and legends. The classical world saw the moon as a symbol of ecstatic Divinity, the Mystery and magic that dwelt in the night. The moon was otherworldly, but inextricably tied to the mortal experience. \u201cDrawing down\u201d the moon means not literally to pull the moon from the sky, but to draw the essence of the moon into oneself, so its light can reveal the latent divinity within the soul. Thus revealed, the Goddess Within manifests in the flesh of her witch and priestess.</div><div>This concept is the Sodality of the Tor\u2019s most sacred Mystery, in which one of their number draws into herself a shard of the Eternal Divine. In this way, the Sodality understand those divine traits that reside within themselves, and foster them accordingly. Their rites shape a Sodality witch\u2019s soul, making it more and more like that presence she communes with during these rites as she walks her path.</div><div>The witches of the Sodality teach that the human soul can embrace godhood only when the soul sets aside the conscious mind. They believe the Supernal is not transcendent, grandly beyond the human understanding; rather, it is immanent, found within all things wild and natural. Thus, by casting aside the reservations and fears of the conscious mind, and allowing the unconscious and primal side of the self free reign, the Awakened (and some gifted Sleepers) can touch the divine.</div><div>Mages outside of the Sodality sometimes believe its devotees give themselves over to possession. The truth is more subtle. A Sodality mage never actually loses consciousness during these rites, though her experience may be so overwhelming that she does not remember everything that happened. The witch who draws down Divinity is herself, but not \u2014 her essential self remains, but has expressed itself as a divine being, in the same way that her essential self is normally expressed as a human being.</div><div>Sodality witches usually find that their divine selves are very familiar to them from their own studies in world mythology, and these witches often take shadow names based on the god they see in the moon\u2019s mirror. When one of these witches speaks of \u201cdrawing down Artemis\u201d or \u201caspecting the Morrigan,\u201d they mean letting the qualities attributed to those gods rise in their own personalities. They don\u2019t let a god in; they let a god out.</div><div>The Sodality\u2019s prime ceremony is the Rite of Drawing Down, held during full moons. Members of this Legacy may travel quite a distance to take part in this rite; traditionally, the elder who initiated a witch of the Sodality hosts these rituals, and all those she has trained will converge to take part in the ritual. However, the demands of Awakened life sometimes preclude this, and elders will usually welcome any member of the Sodality who is in the area. </div><div>Sleepwalkers sometimes attend these gatherings. Most of these people belong to a coven of the witchcult backed by the Sodality. Some members of the Legacy support or even lead covens of traditionalist witches, whose members lead lives that are not outwardly involved in occultism. Many members of the Sodality recruit members of such covens as Allies, Contacts and Sleepwalker Retainers. </div><div>Mages who know the Sodality only by reputation often believe the Legacy recruits only women, since classical and modern pagan thought treats its primary symbol as feminine. Other mages believe the men of the Sodality \u201cdraw down the Sun\u201d in a fashion different from the Legacy\u2019s women. </div><div>Neither of these misconceptions is true. Though Western occult systems call the moon a feminine symbol, witches (a term applied to both men and women) of the Sodality know that the moon is properly a symbol of ecstatic Divinity, a symbol under which the gods of all Dionysian expressions of religion gather. </div>",alternateNickname:"Spiral Walkers",orders:"The Guardians of the Veil and the Mysterium welcome Sodality witches most readily, for the Sodality values the keeping and discovering of secrets. In the British Isles, the Spiral Walkers enjoy special respect from the Guardians because of one special act of sacrifice: the Lammas Night Working of World War II, which prevented the Mysteries from falling into the most profane hands imaginable.<div>Other orders welcome members of the Sodality whose god-selves has some connection to the ideals of that order. Gods of crafts and skill, chaos and trickster-gods often find the Free Council amenable. Spiral Walkers with martial god-selves might join the Adamantine Arrow, just as those Spiral Walkers whose god-selves are divine royalty may find the Silver Ladder to their liking. </div>",appearance:"In everyday life, members of the Sodality of the Tor rarely look as though they belong to a cult that conducts ecstatic dances under the full moon. In fact, many Spiral Walkers take great pains to avoid looking \u201codd,\u201d preferring to wear simple, respectable clothing appropriate for their callings. Many do come to prefer the freedom of looser clothing, however. Fortunately, few corners of modern society now demand corsets, stranglingly tight collars or other restrictive clothing. The most sacred symbols of the Sodality are the circle, the moon and the spiral. Many of these witches wear bracelets, rings and necklaces of semiprecious stones (particularly stones of organic origin, such as amber or jet) that include these symbols.",background:"Mages who join the Sodality come from all walks of life, though many of them already had ties to British witchcraft. Many in the Sodality belong to traditional witchcraft covens or even some of the old witchcraft families of England. Others of the Sodality are involved with English anthropology or archaeology. If they weren\u2019t part of such groups before their Awakening, they may join them afterward.",organizzation:"The Sodality operates in groups called covens. A coven usually consist of one or two Sodality mages leading several more un-Awakened members (usually reflected by the Sleepwalker Retainers Merit). The mage serves as the High Priest or High Priestess who performs the sacred rites and teaches the Sodality\u2019s doctrine that magic expresses the inner divinity of human beings. However, magic is not Divinity itself: Sleepers can experience moments of godhood, too.<div>At the Legacy\u2019s core, the base interaction among members of the Sodality is between the teacher and apprentice. This one-on-one training is the social foundation for interaction among the members of this Legacy \u2014 members are known by their initiators, and most members of the Sodality can quote their \u201clineages\u201d back to the 1800s and beyond.</div><div>Most Sodality members belong to five major \u201cbranches,\u201d based on the common initiators to whom members can be traced. These roughly correspond to geographical areas, but only as a matter of convenience rather than a strict rule: if a mage wants to join the Sodality, she probably chooses a tutor in her own area.</div><div><i>Ebudae:</i>This branch, one of the Sodality\u2019s two oldest branches, began near the New Forest area in Britain. Made up of old witch families and their retainers, the Ebudae trace their lineage back to the 1400s by name, though they claim the Legacy has been around much longer. A matriarch of the Ebudae organized the Lammas Night Working. Additionally, most members of the Sodality in India and several other former British colonies come from this line.</div><div><i>Gretna:</i> This branch takes its name from the village where the branch began. It is at least as old as the Ebudae line. The Gretna occupy northern Britain and counts many Scottish witches among its initiates. Gretna witches have long-running rivalries with the Ebudae, and each branch likes to claim that the other sprang from it. Similar to the Ebudae, the Gretna can trace their lineages of initiation back to the 1400s.</div><div><i>Rochlaer:</i> The Rochlaer branch is confined primarily to Germany and the Netherlands. They are nearly as old as the Ebudae and Gretna, able to trace their initiation lineages back to the early 1500s. The Rochlaer have absorbed no small amount of Norse and Germanic customs into their ceremonies and ritual magic, including Norse seidhr (cauldron-scrying) and rune-cutting, and German hexencraft. Many Rochlaer join the Mysterium, which appreciates their skill at divination.</div><div><i>Orsanith:</i> The Orsanith branch is primarily American and, compare to the other branches of the Legacy. Orsanith was an American Thyrsus who met an Ebudeainitiated member of the Sodality during the Great War. The two of them hit it off, and Orsanith found himself fascinated by the Ebudea\u2019s theology. They became lovers first, and then she initiated him into the Legacy. Orsanith returned to America in the 1920s, and the Legacy has spread since then. Most American Sodality come from the Orsanith branch, though Appalachia and New England has a few isolated Ebudae, Gretna and Rochlaer lineages that date back to colonial times.</div><div><i>Janiluth:</i> The Janiluth branch began in the 1940s, when a young witch of the Gretna line broke with her elders. She moved to Australia (some say she fled with some of the grimoires her initiator loaned her, and refused to return them) and established her own branch of the Legacy. Though Gretna initiates tend to be quite hostile to those of the Janiluth line, they are accepted (likely due to their welcome by the Ebudae, whom most other Sodality realize are simply doing so to spite the Gretna).</div><div>A cabal called the Avalonian Sisterhood tends the Glastonbury Tor on behalf of the Sodality as a whole. The Sisterhood traditionally includes at least one member of each branch. Other branches have appeared and disappeared over the centuries, as lines simply dwindle in number or crumble due to infighting.</div>",suggestedOblations:"The spiral dance performed with several witches, ritual consumption of cakes and ale, passionate sex, ecstatic dance under the light of the moon ",concepts:"Wiccan high priestess, British anthropologist, pagan theologist, author or teacher, musician or dancer, professional herbalist, tour guide of Neolithic sites, midwife",historySocietyCulture:"<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>This Legacy is an old one, of that there can be no doubt. Members of the Sodality have in their possession a variety of grimoires, journals and other accounts that date back centuries, and at least two of the lines verifiably trace their origins back to the 1400s. That\u2019s just when the Legacy began recording its history, though \u2014 before then, witchcraft was simply passed down from one Awakened to another. Quite possibly, this Legacy may be found nearly anywhere in the world, if only as a solitary practice between a mentor and her apprentice.</div><div>As an organization, however, the Sodality is very much a British phenomenon. Despite spreading around the world in recent centuries, the Sodality retains a distinctly British flavor to many of its techniques, and is strongest where the British have settled. Sodality legend claims that the first witches who practiced their Legacy\u2019s techniques came to Britain in the long-ago days of the Roman Empire. Indeed, according to the folklorists of the Legacy, the Sodality\u2019s origins lie with the coming of Joseph of Arimathea and the planting of the Thorn of Glastonbury.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Thorn of Glastonbury</h3><div>According to popular British legend, Joseph of Arimathea was a merchant who knew Christ. Joseph came to Britain after the Crucifixion, bearing the Holy Grail, said to be filled with the blood of Christ gathered while He hung on the cross. As Joseph lay down to rest on Glastonbury Tor, he pushed his staff, a piece of wood cut from a thorne tree, into the earth beside him. When he awoke, the staff had sprouted roots and branches. Taking this as a sign, he placed the Grail within the Chalice Well, which to this day has reddish-tinted waters.</div><div>The usually-pagan members of the Sodality add little to this story, save to mention that one of Joseph of Arimathea\u2019s associates, a middle-aged woman named Thana, also decided to remain at the Tor. Thana was a Roman witch who claimed to have inherited old Etruscan witchcraft, passed down among peasants long after the Etruscan culture had been assimilated into that of Rome.</div><div>The Sodality claims that Thana found many of the native Awakened here, and found that their ways were similar; so much so, she initiated them into the techniques that became the foundation for the Sodality of the Tor.</div><div>The Sodality teaches that its early days were spent in quiet growth, as the witches of the Tor sought out their sisters in the hidden vales and hills of the British Isles. Many witches chose not to embrace the Sodality\u2019s teachings, but some did, and the Sodality grew.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>A Time of Hysteria</h3></div><div>According to the legends of the Sodality, the witch-craze times almost never touched the Spiral Walkers. Most Awakened are more than capable of escaping Sleeper notice, and, failing that, Awakened are more than capable of escaping imprisonment and torture. Most importantly, however, the witch-hunters targeted people with traits that the Sodality did not possess: all too often, solitary widows with a bit of land and no one to defend them.</div><div>In contrast, the families of the Sodality were large and sprawling by this era, with small witch families arrayed around initiated Spiral Walkers, ready to help them whenever there was need. As a result, the Sodality was forced to simply watch as many innocents were killed for their property. The people of these times saw tremendous change around them \u2014 political and social reform, plague and war \u2014 and they panicked, seeking a source of these changes that they could attack or control. So, they blamed \u201cwitches\u201d for their fears, and tried to find those witches and kill them.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The First Witch War</h3></div><div>In the late 1400s, members of the Ebudae and Gretna lines began squabbling, each claiming that the other had performed some great wrong. The precise details of what happened vary with each teller \u2014grimoires and artifacts certainly disappeared from both sides and accusations of theft flew fast and thick. The harsh feelings on both sides grew until there weren\u2019t simply words being exchanged, but curses.</div><div>By the start of the 1500s, war raged among the Sodality witches of Britain, and several of these conflicts drew in other Awakened. By the time the Awakened of Britain understood that this was more than a simple feud among some individual witches, the conflict was already out of control. Though the Consilii eventually stopped the conflict, many mages had already died.</div><div>Many Spiral Walkers refused to take sides and fled what they considered a fool\u2019s war. These witches emigrated and formed the Rochlaer line in continental Europe. To this day, some Rochlaer regard the Ebudae and Gretna lines as hot-heads more concerned with their own pride than performing the Legacy\u2019s sacred duties.</div><div>Among the other Awakened, the Sodality\u2019s name became associated with bickering, selfish mages for quite a few decades after this witch war. The shamefaced Sodality slunk out of sight and kept a low profile for centuries.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Lammas Night Working</h3><div>It wasn\u2019t until World War II that the Sodality emerged once again into the eyes of Britain\u2019s Consilii. This time, London was in the middle of the Blitz and it looked like Hitler would invade. Ebudae leaders sent out a call to the other lines, and the Sodality answered. Members of all of the European lines gathered on the cliffs overlooking the Channel between Britain and France, on the other side of which the Nazi forces gathered. </div><div>On Lammas Night, the covens gathered in force. Not only Sodality were present \u2014 many other Awakened witches arrived as well, with witch family members and Sleepwalker members of covens to lend their aid. A great Working was performed, an act of magic so taxing that several older witches died from exhaustion and Pattern Scourging as they wove a great spell to defend their beloved Albion from invasion. Shortly after the Working, Hitler changed his mind and invaded the Soviet Union instead. Britain\u2019s mages still don\u2019t know if the Lammas Night Working was responsible: Nazi leaders made plenty of crazy decisions all by themselves. </div><div>The Sodality\u2019s elders and a few other mages know the Working was really aimed at members of their own Legacy who\u2019d fallen in with the Nazi party. Even Sleeper historians know about the Nazi leaders\u2019 occult obsessions. The Guardians of the Veil decided the Nazis\u2019 allies in the Spiral Walkers shouldn\u2019t have a chance to tell Hitler\u2019s henchmen any more about the real supernatural, and pressured the Legacy\u2019s leaders to deal with the situation. To this day, the British lines still watch the Rochlaer carefully, though the German Sodality claims it expunged all such elements from their lineage.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>Some mages despise the Sodality as wild men and women who give themselves over to possession, while other mages respect the natural, primal wisdom the Sodality discover within. Many of the Obrimos are fascinated by the Sodality\u2019s ideas of inner divinity, though also frightened by that loss of control.</div><div>Many older or historically-minded mages consider the Sodality quarrelsome and prone to old, ridiculous rivalries and lineage-grudges more appropriate to Sleeper occultists than to the truly Awakened. Indeed, these mages question the \u201cinner divinity\u201d of the Spiral Walkers. Surely, if they were tapping into godhood, wouldn\u2019t they at least act a bit more wise and dignified in their dealings?</div><div>In reply, the Sodality reminds their fellow Awakened that the old pagan gods were always rivals, competing and back-stabbing one another. Why should the witches who embody these old gods act any differently?</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Tor</h3><div>Though the Sodality takes its practices and theology from a blend of classical and Celtic concepts, the Legacy\u2019s name comes from an English site: the Glastonbury Tor. Believed by some to be the location of the mythic Avalon of Arthurian legendry, the Tor is an impressive, steep hill, set with a sevenfold spiral path.</div><div>Sodality mages point out that, when viewed from above, the Glastonbury spiral path resembles patterns found elsewhere: for instance, the Cretan spiral found on many Mediterranean coins and believed to have some ties to the labyrinth of legend. The pattern also appears on a seventh-century bc Etruscan vase, a pillar in Pompeii and the \u201cMother Earth\u201d symbol of the Arizona Hopi.</div><div>Furthermore, the spiral divides the hill into seven tiers \u2014 like the Mem of Hindu mythology (the seven-leveled mountain where dwell the gods) and the seven-tiered Babylonian ziggurat. Awakened loremasters say Glastonbury Tor falls squarely within traditions and symbolic forms spread around the world by the Atlantean diaspora.</div><div>The Tor itself holds a very potent Hallow; its tass accumulates in the Chalice Well. Of course, the Avalonian Sisterhood collects the Mana-charged water every night at midnight, so the token phials of water that most visitors to the Tor take away are simply vials of well water.</div><div>The Awakened of the Tor have approached the problem of how to prevent the gradual weakening of the Tor\u2019s Hallow in a unique way: rather than allow it to simply become a sight-seeing location, and risk the irreverence that has vitiated other sites (notably Stonehenge), the Sodality encourage all visitors, regardless of their faith, to see the Tor as a sacred site.</div><div>Glastonbury proper holds a number of churches, seated next to New Age and occult shops. The tours offered all emphasize the overall sacredness of the site, rather than focusing on any one religion\u2019s idea. Meditation walks are led up the Tor itself, with requests that participants remain silent and thoughtful on the trip up the Tor, and all of the tour guides discuss the syncretic expressions of sacredness that the Tor has held through the centuries.</div><div>Numerous Sodality members live and work nearby. In fact, mages who want to join the Sodality are usually told to come here: if one mage meets another Awakened at the Glastonbury Tor, she is probably a Spiral Walker or a seeker after membership.</div><div>At the top of the Tor proper stands St. Michael\u2019s Tower. This impressive tower once served to magically contain the power of the Glastonbury Tor Hallow, but does so no longer. The tower was named for the Archangel known as a great dragonslayer. In Britain, lines of natural, earthly power are called \u201cdragons\u201d \u2014 so the tower itself served as a \u201cdragonslayer,\u201d containing this energy.</div><div>In the early 1960s, the Sodality\u2019s elders decided that it simply wasn\u2019t practical to tap the Hallow in the Tor\u2019s most visible tourist attraction. The Sodality\u2019s elders dismantled the restraining magics of the tower so the Hallow\u2019s energy would circulate through the entire Tor. The Hallow\u2019s power became less secure from other mages \u2014 but a lot more secure from Sleeper intrusion. Since then, many people have reported seeing strange lights and bobbing balls of energy spiraling up the Tor at night. Many visitors also claim to have seen the interior of St. Michael\u2019s Tower illuminated by a strange white light with no discernable source.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Witch Families</h3></div><div>In places where the Sodality has existed for multiple generations, there are bound to be witch families. Most such families are made up of Sleepwalkers, and they produce more than a few Proximi, as well. These families have no single defining trait, other than their blood relation to a witch of the Sodality and their share in the secrets of that witch.</div><div>Children growing up in these witch families see all manner of strange things that their parents urge them not to talk about. Because of this early and frequent exposure to frankly supernatural events, most of these children grow into Sleepwalkers. The witch families of the Sodality usually have excellent fortune and health, thanks to the magic of their family members.</div><div>Spiral Walkers do not perceive these families as servants or retainers. They are simply one\u2019s relations, all of whom share in a great secret. Just because a member of the family Awakens doesn\u2019t mean that the family member is somehow greater than she used to be \u2014 in fact, by the family\u2019s standards, she now simply has more responsibility.</div><div>Mages who join the Sodality are often encouraged to marry into the family of their tutors, or are flatout adopted into the families (at least informally). A Sodality witch\u2019s tutor is often considered a parent, so that one\u2019s mentor\u2019s siblings become one\u2019s aunts and uncles, their parents become one\u2019s grandparents, and so on. The Sodality stands only on family titles \u2014 the Spiral Walkers need nothing else.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>The Sodality of the Tor does not, as an organization, select who receives initiation into their Legacy. Instead, individual Spiral Walkers simply decide to take on apprentices they consider worthy. Of course, applicant mages need some essential understandings, and some must be trained in the techniques of European witchcraft (as reflected in the Skill requirements in the first attainment).</div><div>No one else can gainsay a Spiral Walker\u2019s choice in pupils, for the Sodality prizes autonomy. In this fashion, the Spiral Walkers consider themselves a family: a grandmother does not tell her daughter whether or not to have a child. (At least, not in a well-adjusted family.) The best a grandmother can do is try to rectify any mistakes in upbringing that her daughter may make with her child.</div><div>The initiations of the Sodality are neither physically rigorous, such as those of the Perfected Adepts, nor psychologically traumatic, such as those of the Clavicularius. However, the Sodality\u2019s initiations are certainly transformative, for, at their apex, they involve a literal meeting with the Awakened\u2019s godself, a glimpse of the mage as a Supernal being.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The First Initiation</h3></div><div>The first initiation takes place within a spiral labyrinth. Preferably, this happens at the Glastonbury Tor proper, but this is not always feasible. Many Sodality witches with ample sanctum space build rose-hedge labyrinths or full stone ones somewhere in their area. Other Spiral Walkers simply construct labyrinths from bales of hay or stones laid out in a footpath. All that is necessary is the walking of that pattern.</div><div>The initiation always takes place at night, and occurs naked, after the applicant drinks a mildly hallucinogenic elixir prepared by steeping certain herbs in hot, spiced wine. The dedicant begins dancing the spiral when the moon rides high in the sky, as her tutor begins a chant in Atlantean, invoking the Supernal self of her new apprentice.</div><div>When the apprentice reaches the center of the spiral, she kneels before a steaming cauldron filled with more of the herb-infused wine. The apprentice gazes into the cauldron, catching sight of the moon\u2019s reflection in the brew, and then takes up the chalice that is her Path tool. She scoops some of the brew from the middle of the moon\u2019s reflection, symbolically capturing the moon itself in her cup, and then downs the mixture.</div><div>The hallucinations intensify then. The tutor watches carefully to make sure the student hasn\u2019t inadvertently poisoned herself with an overdose \u2014 but the experience must be allowed to take its toll. Most Sodality witches know the precise mixture of herbs to allow their apprentices to walk that razor\u2019s line between an ineffective brew and a poisonous concoction. The tutor shapes the pupil\u2019s soul as the pupil engages in a vision-quest for her divine self.</div><div>When the apprentice emerges from her inner journey, she has met her god-self, learned its secret name and communed with it. Then, the witch helps her apprentice to her feet and guides her through her first Drawing Down the Moon ritual, helping the apprentice make manifest what she has already encountered within.</div><div>Once the Supernal self manifests itself within the apprentice, the tutor bows low before this Divinity and introduces herself and asks for any advice the god-self may have in teaching the new witch. Mentors always listen carefully to this advice, for the purpose of initiation into this Legacy is the manifestation of the Supernal self \u2014 and none know how to better achieve this than the inner god itself.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Subsequent Initiations</h3><div>The second and third initiations are called \u201celevations,\u201d indicating that once the first initiation has occurred, subsequent ones simply build upon the first, rather than imparting something new.</div><div>The second initiation takes place within the center of the spiral, where the process is repeated. The mentor simply watches over the Drawing Down in this instance, and, once it occurs, speaks an invocation of that godself, drawing it further out. Many Sodality witches show their first physical manifestations at this time, and are often sore afterwards. This ritual takes place entirely in the center of the spiral, over the cauldron.</div><div>Like the second, the third initiation begins in the center of the spiral. Again, the Drawing Down occurs, and the tutor invokes the god-self with an Atlantean invocations that unlock the third attainment. Then, the god-self, in complete control of the apprentice\u2019s body, walks the spiral in reverse, moving from the center of the spiral to the outer.</div><div>The spiral in these initiations symbolizes the inner journey toward Divinity. The first initiation has the apprentice walking into the spiral, seeking out the center of the Supernal self. The second initiation has the apprentice dwelling in the center of the spiral, and the third has the journey of the god-self to the outside of the spiral, representing the manifestation of the inner divinity into the outer world.</div>",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"<div>Spiral Walkers do not use their attainments lightly. In fact, most Sodality members prefer to use them in ritual context, during the gatherings of their covens during the full moon. That said, the witches of the Sodality understand that these abilities come with the manifestation of Divinity, and so are their birthright.<div>Each Sodality attainment is performed by the process of \u201cdrawing down the Moon.\u201d This is not the near-possession of some ecstatic practices, such as the process of \u201cbeing ridden\u201d by the loa, in voudoun practice. Rather, the Sodality witch attunes herself to her god-self, stripping away those aspects of the ego that prevent the expression and manifestation of her inner divinity. To many, drawing down the Moon feels like a presence outside of the self, but that is because the process strips away the mortal ego \u2013 it feels like surrendering oneself to something else, but it is simply the sublimation of the mortal self to allow the god-self to manifest.</div><div>In game terms, this does not cause the mage to be played as an NPC.

Mages take shadow names for this very reason, so that others cannot harm them with sympathetic magic \u2014 but what is a name, truly, and what defines the name of a thing? At what point does the name \u201cJane Smith\u201d cease to define the witch who calls herself Branwen Boudicca? The Stone Scribes believe that a person\u2019s name changes and grows subtly throughout his existence. Only at death, the cessation of existence, is a person\u2019s true name fixed. The Stone Scribes call this the Final Name, and it is more than merely an identifying label that eases the working of sympathetic spells. A person\u2019s Final Name is an echo of that person\u2019s soul, a sublime expression of the sum total of the fate that guided the life of the name\u2019s owner. The Stone Scribes believe that only by knowing a person\u2019s Final Name can you truly know the person \u2014 it is the ultimate record of who that person was, stripped of all layers of deceit and subterfuge.</div><div>First and foremost, the Stone Scribes are recordkeepers. The Scribes treat the collection of as many Final Names as possible as a sacred mission. Members of this Legacy lurk in hospitals, nursing homes and battlefields, places where many Final Names are set each day. The Scribes record these names using Arcane formulae and methods little-known to other mages, usually on the large stone tablets that earned the Legacy its name.</div><div>Unlike many in the Mysterium, the Stone Scribes do not merely acquire knowledge for its own sake. They collect, store and meticulously cross-reference as many Final Names as they can acquire, because their founder charged them with a sacred duty he said came from God Himself. By tracing the myriad threads of sympathetic connection back through multiple Final Names, the Namers believe they can reconstruct the Final Names of the long-deceased, up to and including the ancient lords of Atlantis. By learning those millennia-dead Names, the Scribes  claim they will be able to conjure up the shades of their distant ancestors and gain firsthand knowledge of the height of Atlantis \u2014 and direct tutelage in potent, forgotten Atlantean magic.</div><div>Not all Scribes are simple record-keepers, though. When a Namer falls to Hubris, she sometimes grows impatient waiting for death to come at its own pace, and decides to take her victims\u2019 names at the times and places of her choosing. These so called Name Takers are assassins and killers, ritually murdering people whose names they desire and stealing their names at the moment of death. The Namers despise these apostates and accuse them of stealing souls along with Final Names, not to mention other left-handed practices \u2014 but even as the Scribes hate the Name Takers, Stone Scribes fear how easily they might slip down that path.</div>",alternateNickname:"Namers or Name Takers",orders:"Almost all Stone Scribes are members of the Mysterium. The Legacy began in that order, and the Mysterium shares the Scribes\u2019 fascination with preserving ancient knowledge (even if Mysterium members sometimes consider the Scribes too focused on one specific type of rather esoteric knowledge). Some Scribes gravitate to the Adamantine Arrow: they want to wipe out the Name-Taker cult or serve as \u201cwar journalists\u201d who record the Final Names of fallen mages. Modern-minded Namers sometimes join the Free Council and scribe Final Names with power tools and precision stonecutters. Few Scribes join the Silver Ladder or the Guardians of the Veil, since the Legacy cares more about collecting and studying Final Names than temporal power or keeping the secrets of the Mysteries from the Sleepers.

The recording of Final Names is a solemn duty, and the Scribes dress soberly to show respect for their job.",background:"Many Stone Scribes were touched by the loss of death at some point in their lives. Some lost a parent, friend or loved one, while others had their own near-death experiences. Sometimes, this event led to the mage\u2019s Awakening. Other times, death was merely a powerful event that stayed with the mage for the rest of her life. Whatever the nature of the death, what affects the mage who seeks to become a Namer in Stone is often the senseless loss of the decedent\u2019s knowledge and life experiences. While Final Names do not hold personal histories of their owners, at least they are tangible relics of the deceased.",organizzation:"Almost all of the Stone Scribes belong to the Mysterium, and thus they simply fall into the Mysterium\u2019s hierarchy. When groups of Scribes come together to form a Bibliotheca (\u201cLibrary\u201d), they assign rank based on seniority. The most experienced Namer (not necessarily the one with highest Gnosis or Arcana ratings), called the Philologus, directs all those underneath him. They in turn have authority over those with less experience than themselves. A Namer can only gainsay a superior if two-thirds of his own inferiors also oppose the superior. Apprentices are special cases in Bibliothecae: although apprentices are the lowest-ranked members, they are considered to speak with the voices of their tutors. In other words, if an apprentice says, \u201cMy tutor feels that this is a poor course of action,\u201d the rest of the Bibliotheca treat that statement as having come from the tutor\u2019s mouth. Apprentices seldom abuse this privilege more than once, and wise apprentices, never. In a similar vein, each tutor is considered the absolute authority when it comes to her own apprentices\u2019 training. Even the Philologus cannot countermand an instruction given from a tutor to his apprentice.<div>Depending upon the local presence of the Stone Scribes and the preferences of the individual mages, a Bibliotheca might also be a cabal or the Scribes might belong to their own individual cabals and come together only to discuss matters related to the Legacy\u2019s business. If the Mysterium is strong in the region, the Bibliotheca is often an adjunct to the local Athenaeum, with the Philologus serving as a deputy Curator over the library of scrivened Final Names. If the Mysterium has little presence, the Bibliotheca might serve as sole custodian of the local Athenaeum, with the Philologus pulling double-duty as Curator.</div>",suggestedOblations:"Practicing gematria, meditating while intoning sacred names of gods, angels and demons, carving a tombstone, taking grave rubbings, extending a family history back another generation or discovering a new relative on a family tree",concepts:"Cancer-ward doctor, nursing home attendant, combat journalist, historical biographer, Name-Taking killer, prison guard, gravedigger, police photographer",historySocietyCulture:"<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2></div><div>During the Golden Age of Atlantis, the Stone Scribes say, there was no need for their Legacy. When people passed on, their souls ascended to the Supernal World and dwelled for a time in the realm of Stygia before returning to the lower world, their memories gone but the sum of their countless lives still bound up in the resonance of their Names. The forefathers of the Stone Scribes were not archivists but seers who could follow the winding paths of their own Names or the Names of others to gain forgotten wisdom from past lives. These Name Walkers were among the mages who first explored and studied the Astral Realms, reaching deep into the Temenos and the Dreamtime.</div><div>After the Fall, the cosmology of the world changed drastically. No longer did the souls of the departed return from Stygia; they either lingered as ghosts, or vanished beyond the ken of the Awakened. The onetime Name Walkers found themselves obsessed with this new concept of a permanent death, and that obsession drew them to the Watchtower of the Lead Coin. The new generations of Necromancers searched for a way to preserve Names lost to the vagaries of the Abyss. Their early attempts involved harvesting souls \u2014 which led to madness and horror, and to a bitter wizards\u2019 war amongst the sect.</div><div>Little is now known of the Soul War. The victors destroyed the names of the soul-takers, so that no later mage could call up their shades.</div><div>In the aftermath of the Soul War, a cabal of Moros mages whom legend calls the Unnamed Pentacle, studying Name Walker texts that were already ancient, learned once more how to follow the winding threads of resonance that surrounded all sentient beings to their sources. To preserve at least some remnant of the dying, the Unnamed Pentacle studied the Arcana of Death and Fate. Eventually, these mages discovered a spell to transcribe an individual\u2019s name at the moment of death, preserving an echo of the person\u2019s soul for future generations. Because these mages scribed the Final Names they collected into stone monoliths erected in the image of the Watchtowers, or on large stelae, they earned the appellation Stone Scribes. </div><div>The early Stone Scribes perfected their art in ancient Egypt. The Namers say their monoliths inspired the Egyptians to erect obelisks. The cartouche, an oval carved or drawn around an Egyptian\u2019s name, imitates the stelae on which the Scribes also recorded names. Like the Scribes, the Egyptians believed the name carried the essence of the self: as long as the name endured, so did the soul. </div><div>For millennia, the Stone Scribes were a tiny, looselyaffiliated society within the Mysterium. They became a Legacy in the 13th century. Arnobius, a Coptic monk and Namer in Stone, received what he referred to as a \u201csublime revelation from the Lord\u201d while attending the funeral of his abbot. The Awakened monk spent months sequestered in the tombs of his abbey, meditating on ancient names of power and casting gematria while illuminated only by the wan flickering of corpse-candles. According to Namer tradition, God (or some other higher being) revealed to Arnobius the means to reconstruct the Name of one long-dead by following the sympathetic connections back from other Final Names.</div><div>Arnobius emerged from the catacombs a changed man: where once he had been of rotund stature and pleasant disposition, he emerged a gaunt specter of a man who wore an aura of quiet solemnity like a cloak. He left the monastery and began traveling across North Africa, Palestine, Syria and Europe, preaching his new Legacy to any Consilium that would have him. Wherever the Namers had established a Bibliotheca, Arnobius found ready converts. Within 20 years, almost the entire sect in Europe and the Near East was subsumed into the Legacy. The Stone Scribes as a sect of allied mages continued in other parts of the world, notably India and China, but in the past few centuries even those branches have joined the Legacy. Mysterium archeologists say that Stone Scribes practiced their art in pre\u2013Columbian Mexico and Peru, but these longsundered, parallel lineages were lost in the European conquests and destruction of native kingdoms.</div><div>Arnobius continued to guide the Stone Scribes as \u201cPhilologus Primus\u201d for decades, personally establishing most of the Legacy\u2019s traditions and practice. The Scribes stopped carving Final Names on obelisks, crypts and other large monuments in favor of stone tablets. Arnobius used his clout within the Coptic Church to have Namers appointed abbots of many monasteries known for their large libraries, and instituted a standardized method of cataloging libraries of Final Names. Namers in Stone also obtained positions of authority in many Roman Catholic monasteries.</div><div>The centuries since Arnobius\u2019 disappearance have seen a slow but steady decline of the Stone Scribes. Their connections in the Church faded as too few Philologi were willing to play politics and were ousted in favor of more popular (Sleeper) abbots, and the Bibliothecae had to scramble to find new homes. Universities became popular bases of operation for some Scribes, while others chose to hide in plain sight, setting up shop as stelographers (tombstone makers), carving Final Names into the headstones of their owners\u2019 graves.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>Most mages think the Stone Scribes is a harmless clique of scholars devoted to a curious and obscure magical practice. No mage would deny that names have power, of course, but even most Mysterium willworkers think there are better ways to learn about the past than writing names on rocks. The Stone Scribes allow this perception to continue \u2014 if other mages even thought the Namers had access, or were even close to attaining access to the secret knowledge of the Atlantean kings, the Legacy would come under siege. Scholars desperate for knowledge of magic\u2019s Golden Age would mob Bibliothecae seeking audiences with ancient ghosts, while mages fearful of the power the Scribes might gain from the dead would come with knives in the dark.</div><div>Outside the Mysterium, few mages even know that the Namers exist \u2014 not out of any deliberate attempt at secrecy on the part of the Stone Scribes, but simply because most Legacy members are content to perform their self-appointed duty without drawing attention to themselves. When members of the other orders do notice the Scribes, it is often thanks to the crimes of a rogue Name-Taker. Consequently, the Stone Scribes sometimes have a poor reputation outside the Mysterium.</div><div>The Scribes\u2019 culture is largely built around respect for the dead and the belief that all souls should leave a record of their passing. This respect often manifests as an intense curiosity about the lives of people whose Final Names they record. Some Namers interview friends or family members of the recently deceased to gain a more complete picture of their lives, while others go back further and study what life was like 50, 100 or even 1,000 years ago or more. Some Namers even go so far as to adopt such a lifestyle, either for a short time or permanently, but these anachronisms are considered eccentric even by other Scribes.</div><div>As befits a Legacy whose reason for existence is the recording of Final Names, labels and names form a major part of the Scribes\u2019 lives. Most Stone Scribes have at least four names themselves: their birth name, the shadow name they adopted upon Awakening, a name given to them by their tutor upon being accepted as a pupil and used among other Namers and, finally, a private name given by their tutors and only used between tutor and apprentice. A Stone Scribe who takes an apprentice has a fifth name, privately given to the Scribe by his apprentice. These tutor/apprentice secret names are rarely complimentary, but are usually given in the spirit of familial ribbing rather than outright spite.</div><div>The Namers\u2019 magic is built around the study of names, labels and descriptors of all sorts, all to trace the proverbial branches back to the roots of Awakened society. Names may be transitory until death, but even the knowledge of a person\u2019s Momentary Name can prove useful. Namers employ a variety of magical practices involving names, but gematria is one of the most popular. Protective amulets inscribed with repeating patterns of names of power, and the Solomonic practices of summoning spirits using the manifold names of God are also common Scribe praxes.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Induction into the Stone Scribes is generally a straightforward and civilized process. The prospective Namer simply approaches a more experienced member of the Legacy, usually one she knows personally, and asks for instruction in the arts of the Scribes. Candidates are accepted as probationary members of the local Bibliotheca (if there is one) and typically set on mundane tasks for anywhere from one to three months. Tasks performed during this time include cataloging archives of Final Names, maintaining the Bibliotheca\u2019s sanctum and, of course, a great deal of studying. Apprentices striving for the first attainment study the magic of names, including gematria, the names of the Angels of the Hours and the planets and various forms of animistic spirit-naming. As the applicant approaches readiness for the first attainment, she learns the spells used to scribe Final Names and preserve them forever. Later in her training, the candidate joins her tutor on his rounds and scribes several Final Names through the use of spells. The apprentice learns about the mystical importance of Final Names, and how they can fade with time if not set down in stone.</div><div>An apprentice also learns the history and legendry of the Legacy itself, from its founding as a sect of the Alae Draconis in Atlantis to its metamorphosis into the Stone Scribes after the Fall. She is expected to learn by heart the minutiae of Arnobius\u2019 life and the rise of the Stone Scribes as a Legacy, and its gradual decline. An apprentice must research the stories of as many as 10 notable Scribes.</div><div>Once a mage proves she can reliably scribe a Final Name, her tutor guides her in crafting her soul. Only then does a tutor impart the Legacy\u2019s techniques for finding the Final Names of the long dead, coaxing them back into full strength so that they may be recorded for future generations. Tutors do not impart the second attainment until a pupil shows her mastery of this technique.</div><div>The third stage of a Scribe\u2019s formal training is usually the most active in her life. She has finished the long hours studying history and occult theory, but is not yet expected to settle down and start a Bibliotheca. A Scribe\u2019s final period of tutelage usually finds her traveling and using the attainments of her Legacy to recover old, unrecorded Final Names. Some Scribes focus on recovering the Final Names of notable Sleepers, but the Legacy places special emphasis on the Final Names of ancient mages. At the last, journeyman Scribes learn to shape their own Momentary Names to match recorded Final Names, allowing the Scribes to sense the sympathetic ties of the mages of old \u2014 ties that sometimes lead to powerful mystic relics or storehouses of occult lore. Once a Scribe masters this magic, the journeyman is considered ready for the third attainment (Gnosis permitting). Only after gaining the third attainment does a Scribe learn the Legacy\u2019s long-term goal to reach the ghosts of Atlantis.</div><div>Upon achieving the third attainment in their Legacy, most Scribes settle down, establish a Bibliotheca and devote themselves to the continued recording of Final Names and training their own apprentices. Some Scribes seek to follow in Arnobius\u2019 footsteps and pursue the mythical fourth attainment and Ascension, while others forego the sedentary life and continue to travel and gather Final Names well into their elder years.</div>",magic:"<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Final Names and Other Magic</h2><div>Once a mage records a Final Name, she or other mages can use it for other magic. The Stone Scribes\u2019 chief interest lies in using Final Names to gain information from the past: a Final Name provides a Known connection to its subject (the same applies to a Momentary Name, while it lasts). So, if a mage wanted to view the life of a long-dead person using Time 2 \u201cPostcognition\u201d (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 260), she would have a Known connection for targeting the spell. A Final Name is just about the best link possible, short of possessing the person\u2019s actual cadaver, for summoning the dead from the Underworld.</div><div>A mage can also use the ties of Fate recorded in the Final Name to affect other people. In this case, however, each sympathetic tie is downgraded one step, compared to having the actual person on hand. Thus, a wife would be Intimately connected to a husband, but only Known to the husband\u2019s recorded Final Name. Extra successes reduce this penalty, but can never raise the \u201cvirtual sympathy\u201d above Known (\u20134 penalty). Naturally, the mage cannot use this information without access to other Arcana. Not knowing a target\u2019s actual name also imposes the usual penalty, which cannot be countered by any number of successes at reading a Final Name.</div><div><b>Example:</b> <i>Dahlia studies the Final Name of one Frank Jefferson and her player achieves one success on Dahlia\u2019s spellcasting roll. She learns that Jefferson has a daughter (Intimate connection). If Dahlia wanted to cast a spell on the daughter, Dahlia\u2019s connection goes from Known (one step down from Intimate) to Encountered (because Dahlia doesn\u2019t know the daughter\u2019s name).</i></div><div><i>Dahlia tries again and, with three successes, and finds that Jefferson had an employee he once fired. This starts as an Acquainted person. If Dahlia wanted to cast a spell on the employee, her connection goes from Acquainted to Encountered for working from a Final Name, but bumps up to Known for the two extra successes; but then drops back to Acquainted for not knowing the employee\u2019s name, for a net penalty of \u20136.</i></div>",attainmentsDescrizione:"The Namers\u2019 beliefs in the power of the Final Name is the guiding principle behind the Legacy\u2019s attainments.

As long as the name is written on some sort of permanent medium, however, and the proper reverence is given, a variety of alternative techniques are permissible.

If the Namer has Death 5, he may use the prolonged Duration chart when determining the Duration of the effect.</div>"},{Nome:"Threnodists",Cammino:["Mastigos"],Ordine:["Council of Free Assemblies"],Nickname:"quantum physicists","Primary Arcanum":["Space"],"Conjunctional Arcanum":["Mind"],"Optional Arcanum":["Mind"],Book:"Legacies the Sublime",leftHanded:!1,descrizione:"<div>The rational world of physics has long been haunted by the irrational specter of mysticism, from Isaac Newton\u2019s hermetic studies to Niels Bohr \u2014 one of the founders of quantum physics and co-author of the controversial Copenhagen Interpretation \u2014 who placed the Taoist yin-yang on his family coat of arms.

Many Threnodists have begun to adopt the styles of neo-hippies, avant-garde artists and musicians, with long hair, comfortable dungarees, sneakers and T-shirts with dazzling tie-dye or fractal designs predominating. Two qualities that seem to be endemic to Threnodists are disarray and clutter.

In their relentless pursuit of what they perceived to be universal truth, they plunged into the deepest conundrum of all \u2014 the inner workings of the most elementary particles of matter \u2014 and thereby inadvertently stumbled across the border that separates the Lie from magical reality.</div><div>Quantum physics, founded in the scientific crucible of rigorous observation and strict adherence to mathematic principle, seemed to demonstrate that the impossible was not only possible but happened everywhere all the time \u2014 merely on scales too tiny and in durations too brief for humans to notice. The basic building blocks of the world twinkled in and out of existence, no more substantial than the play of lights inside the eyelid. Solid reality was reduced to the breaking crest of a wave of probability. Information was seen to leap vast distances instantaneously, borne by mysterious mathematical entanglements. An array of alternate universes, each differentiated from its neighbor by a single iota, crowded in upon the stable material world. And, perhaps most detrimental to scientific objectivity, the slightest scrutiny suddenly acquired the amazing power to alter the factual content of observation.</div><div>This direct assault upon the detached objectivity of science reduced the academic world to what might aptly be described as pandemonium. Even Albert Einstein admitted the efficacy of quantum equations while confessing that he found their implications deeply unsettling. Interpretations of the new theory were propounded to resolve this philosophical crisis, but each seemed to involve greater metaphysical issues that provoked even more outrage. Many scientists refused to accept the broader implications of quantum theory, even though its predictive power produced such technological breakthroughs as television. Other physicists plunged headfirst into the madness \u2014 and, of those, a few found enlightenment.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Virtual Entities</h3><div>Being less than 100 years old, this Legacy can lay little claim to any mythic or legendary roots in Atlantis. That has not stopped the Threnodists from trying, however. Over the past two decades, an electronic facsimile of an \u201cancient manuscript\u201d (dismissed as a fake by most arcane loremasters) has circulated among members of the Mysterium. Chinese, Tibetan and Sanskrit commentary surrounds what purports to be an \u201cAgarthan\u201d copy of an eons-old text written in a tiny delicate script averred by one commentator to be \u201ca Floresian dialect of Lemurian.\u201d</div><div>The text relates the adventures and conversations of one \u201cKwong Du,\u201d the last of a race of diminutive hominids whose seafaring culture spanned the Indian and Pacific Oceans hundreds of thousands of years before the evolution of homo sapiens.

Insisting that in magic, factual accuracy and clear logic are just as important as Supernal revelation, this puckish smartass is depicted as prehistorically inventing \u201cscientific method\u201d as means of critical inquiry into the mysteries of creation.</div><div>Awakened academia\u2019s few responses to this \u201cmanuscript\u201d are largely dismissive. Mysterium critics cite the absurdly high degree of similarity between the words and deeds of the character as recorded in this supposedly archaic source and another obscure character known variously as \u201cQuantus\u201d or \u201cHypercrites,\u201d whose bulging eyes and knowing leer appear in the background of Harvey Kurtzman periodicals, Jay Ward animations, Stan Freberg advertisements and a number of underground comics throughout the 1970s. (All appearances are now prized collector\u2019s items; some Threnodists treat them like holy relics.) Even these detractors, however, laud the scholarship that went into the production of this virtual forgery.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Actual Occasions</h3><div>Apocryphal mythography aside, the verifiable roots of the Threnodic Legacy can be traced back to the 1920s, and one of the pioneers of quantum mathematics, the French aristocrat Prince Louis de Broglie. The Prince began as an ecclesiastical historian, but he turned his intellect toward the nascent technology of radio during World War I. Afterwards, de Broglie continued researching electromagnetism. His PhD thesis at the Sorbonne argued that ordinary gross matter possessed a wave-like aspect, in wavelengths tiny enough to account for the wave-particle duality exhibited in subatomic events. De Broglie\u2019s professor had difficulty accepting the thesis, but when the great Einstein vouched for its mathematical proof, the Prince\u2019s name was permanently inscribed in the textbooks of scientific history.</div><div>A name not found in the textbooks, however, is that of de Broglie\u2019s assistant (some say \u201ccrony\u201d) M. Auguste Etienne-Laurent, le Comte d\u2019Erlette, a descendant of the infamous demonologist who penned Cultes des Goules. This Count, heir to a considerable body of religious (and sacrilegious) lore, had been the Prince\u2019s friend since their earliest days as church historians. The two remained associates up until the years in which quantum theory was first formulated. D\u2019Erlette\u2019s memoirs \u2014 never published but preserved as required reading by Threnodic purists \u2014 recount the adventures the two aristocrats shared in the world of ideas and indicate the causes of a personal rift that ultimately resulted in the dissolution of their friendship around the time de Broglie presented his Sorbonne thesis. The Prince eventually renounced all association with the Count, and even recanted the original interpretation of his mathematical breakthrough. For the rest of his long life, de Broglie, along with Einstein and others, supported the refutation of Heisenberg\u2019s Copenhagen Interpretation in a rival interpretation dubbed \u201cneo-realism.\u201d This interpretation of quantum theory sustains the mechanistic, object-based worldview of classical physics but fails to adequately account for non-local phenomena. Private undocumented conversations reveal that de Broglie also felt a more deeply seated psychological revulsion to his erstwhile colleague.</div><div>During the Great War, d\u2019Erlette claimed he heard voices in radio static. Many radio operators \u2014 including such pioneers as Tesla \u2014 noted this phenomenon, dubbed \u201cghost voices.\u201d D\u2019Erlette, however, believed that these voices addressed him personally. The Count continued to experiment with radio through the post-war years, fine-tuning his equipment to the point that he could carry on extensive dialogues with these voices. Citing d\u2019Erlette\u2019s transcriptions of his otherworldly dialogues, de Broglie pointed out that these voices, with their veiled hints of cosmic revelations and personal power, resemble nothing more or less than the promises offered by medieval demons.</div><div>Threnodists say the scientific community tacitly blacklisted M. le Comte d\u2019Erlette, though there is no way of verifying this assertion. What can be verified is that he retired to his family estate to experiment in private. His only contacts were other gifted physicists on the verge of Awakening. Thus was Threnodism born. The Legacy\u2019s name comes from a suggestion made by a Greek student. From threnody, a wailing dirge or lament, the name may refer to the \u201csound\u201d of the probability waveforms underlying physical existence, the echoes of the Big Bang that form the background noise of radio astronomy or the howls of Pandemonium.</div><div>The first generation of Threnodists were as reclusive as their founder, shunned by the scientific community that spawned them and largely unaware of other mages. These Threnodists labored in isolation, filtering their discoveries into the academic establishment through intermediaries and fronts. These mages avoided accusations of crackpottery only because their Sleeper colleagues propounded, tested and verified theories that were almost as bizarre. In the mid-1950s, however, contingents from the Guardians of the Veil began visiting Threnodist symposia to explain in no uncertain terms the need for secrecy and discretion in matters magical. The Free Council intervened shortly thereafter to help the Threnodists understand their heritage as Awakened beings.</div><div>By the late 1960s and early 1970s, some Threnodists found that pure physics had lost its challenge for those able to break its laws at will. Since perception, awareness and consciousness played significant roles in nearly every interpretation of quantum theory, many Wailers turned their inquisitive wills upon the fields of psychology and neurology. Other Wailers saw in the growing New Age movement a chance to unite the scientific with the supernatural in a public way that could eventually lead to a greater Awakening for the human race as a whole. Still other Threnodists focused on the rapid expansion and increasing sophistication of computers and communications technology as media for the working of the will. Since this time, Threnodism has diversified dramatically while remaining an extremely small and obscure Legacy. </div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2>Most mages ignore Threnodists as harmless madmen, since most mages have difficulty figuring out what any given Threnodist is talking about. Some particularly vocal Threnodists, however, have been denounced as harmful madmen whose brains are infested with demons (which, according to Threnodist theory, they are.) The only order that has so far accepted this Legacy within its ranks is the Free Council, although some of its leaders have had second thoughts about this decision. A few scientifically literate or broad-minded Mysterium mages privately sympathize with the Wailers, but, so far, the order\u2019s leaders block Threnodist attempts to join, and expel mages who embrace the Legacy. <h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Explicate Order </h3><div>Aside from the Free Council, the Mysterium has the most contact with this Legacy, though rarely of the order\u2019s own volition. The scholars find themselves besieged with requests to read and even borrow ancient or obscure texts \u2014 not to mention dangerously volatile substances, rare materials or unique and irreplaceable objects \u2014 that some Threnodist absolutely requires to complete years of research or make some earth-shattering scientific breakthrough. Many Threnodists seem to treat the Mysterium\u2019s libraries as some sort of back-up data storage facility; the order is always receiving bulky shipments and long, system-clogging e-mails filled with reports, theses, notes, articles and reams of raw experimental data. No one can accuse the Threnodists of being stingy with their information.</div><div>Threnodism has not eluded other accusations, though. While the Threnodists never challenged any order\u2019s leadership and maintain an apolitical stance, the Legacy\u2019s wild pronouncements and critical attitudes are seen as a threat by the Silver Ladder. The Guardians of the Veil express concern that this Legacy may reveal too many Supernal secrets to Sleeper scientists, but investigation fails to prove that quantum theory was directly influenced by its parallel magical philosophy. Rather, the direct influence seems to go the other way. A young Legacy by Awakened standards, the Threnodists have no history of corruption within their ranks. The Guardians, however, believe that a Threnodic Scelestus was crucially involved in the development of the atom bomb (though they won\u2019t release the name of their suspect). For several years, the Guardians have tried to enlist the Adamantine Arrow in organizing a good, old-fashioned inquisitorial witch-hunt to root out this unnamed mage\u2019s foul lineage. </div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Implicate Order </h3><div>The way Threnodism organizes itself reflects the interplay between unity and diversity that forms the Legacy\u2019s philosophical underpinnings. Unity comes from common adherence to quantum theory. Diversity comes from the broad applicability of quantum principles to studies and activities beyond physics. Some divide Threnodism into two camps, the \u201cpurists\u201d and the \u201ceclectics.\u201d The former is characterized by a specificity of approach and direction, and what others view as a preoccupation with physical phenomena in the material world. This can be attributed to their origins during the first half of the past century, a time when quantum theory was the exclusive province of the physical sciences. The \u201ceclectics\u201d are the vanguard of more recent developments in the diffusion of quantum thought throughout the scientific world and beyond. Some Wailers like to joke that these two camps represent the \u201cparticle\u201d and \u201cwave\u201d aspects of their Legacy.</div><div>The purists maintain close lines of communication and engage in great experiments that may take several generations to bear fruit. Such tutor-to-student lines follow a more rigid academic model, keeping strict accordance with scientific method even when investigating the vagaries of magical phenomena. Thorough documentation and accurate record keeping are hallmarks of these lineages, and so they are more likely to have contact with the Mysterium. Oddly enough, purist lineages are also the most naturally fractious, even though they are generally free of the academic-industrial sponsorship that fuels competition and hinders cooperation among Sleeper scientists. Other mages view the purists as succumbing to the academic tendency toward hair-splitting debates of nigh-rabbinical exactitude, with reputations and even souls used as stakes in competition between pet theories. </div><div>At the opposite extreme are the \u201ceclectics,\u201d divergent lineages whose interests reflect the diffusion of quantum principles into other sciences beside physics. Chemists, biologists, ecologists, neurologists, psychologists and even disciples of the \u201csoft\u201d social sciences have found that equations originally devised to elucidate the subatomic world prove useful in their own respective fields. Despite the broad differences between these fields, inheritors of these eclectic lineages are sociable and gregarious, both with each other and with the purists. Meetings and interdisciplinary symposiums are frequent, and marked by a high degree of enthusiasm and a free exchange of theoretical speculation and experimental data. While Wailers may pursue a wide range of interests, all Wailers recognize that they share common ground in their particular scientific approach and acknowledge the shared magical ancestry that their Legacy derives from an overarching Supernal truth. </div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Quantum Vacuum</h3><div>Threnodists stand apart from other Mastigos in that they do not take the apparent unity and coherence of their own ego-identities as an unquestioned assumption. Everything in the world, people included, consists of nested hierarchies of demonic intelligences, just as the human psyche is composed of nested hierarchies of thought, feeling, memory and myriad other brain functions. The ego thus seems to disintegrate under close inspection; \u201cI\u201d actually means an ever-changing \u201cWe.\u201d Most mages equate such ego-disintegration with madness and loss of will, so the very notion frightens them to their core. Threnodism, however, likens consciousness and its attendant sense of self-identity to a \u201cBose-Einstein condensate,\u201d a system that behaves in a more unified manner as its overall energy level increases.</div><div>(Although Albert Einstein found quantum mechanics personally dissatisfying as a scientific theory, his incisive critiques and \u201cthought-experiments\u201d designed to disprove its wilder implications served to reinforce and refine it \u2014 increasing its energy level as a system, one might say. Many of the thought-experiments he devised were later performed in actuality and produced results that he contraindicated, proving the predictive power of the quantum equations. Despite Einstein\u2019s opposition, his role in the formation of quantum theory means that his name is irrevocably embedded in many key concepts.)</div><div>One specific example of such a condensate is the laser beam, wherein light particles that would normally scatter in all directions are focused into a single coherent ray and the heat energy thus delivered is highly amplified. Citing ancient occult traditions that equate consciousness with light, Threnodism draws parallels with the concentration of will, the focus and amplification of intention, that every mage must learn in order to fully utilize his powers. Just as any Mastigos must hone his will by focusing it through the Iron Gauntlet, so too must the student of Threnodism learn to channel the light of his awareness through the ruby lens of coherence and focus the laser beam of his will to act as control for the experiments he performs in the laboratory of the universe.</div><div>Another example of the condensate is a superconductor, a substance in which the alignment of its component atoms allows electricity to flow with minimal resistance. Threnodism compares this to the highly \u201csuggestible\u201d ephemera of the spirit world, which display superconductive properties with respect to conscious energies. Threnodists suggest that hyper-dimensional fractal systems of pure awareness, or spirits, may act as part of David Bohm\u2019s \u201chidden variable\u201d in the physical world. The accomplished Threnodist understands consciousness as a non-local attribute of the universe, manifesting as anything from an animal or tree to the shades of the departed or the principles of cosmic order personified as angelic intelligence. Being a scientist, however, she scrutinizes their ephemeral substance in its finest particulate aspect and finds that it is essentially demonic in nature.</div><div>The quanta of Sleeper physics are described as \u201ctendencies toward existence,\u201d waveforms that mathematically depict the probability of a quantum event occurring, for instance, the odds that an electron will strike a TV screen in one place or another. Quantum demons as defined by Threnodism are \u201cthe intention to exist,\u201d consciousness manifesting at such a rudimentary level that it is meaningless to speak of these demons in terms of a \u201cmind\u201d with distinct functions and contents. They are raw subjectivity reaching toward an object that is not there and, by pure act of will, becoming that object for itself. Quantum demons occupy a hyper-dimensional vacuum of which our physical world is only a single aspect; other aspects may be experienced as other realms, interacting with ours only indirectly through the wave function. Human minds, for instance, are emergent properties of nervous systems inhabiting three-dimensions-plus-time, with manifold inner dimensions of thought that Threnodists see as the superimposed waveforms of other dimensions in varying degrees.</div><div>Quantum demons can combine to form aggregate systems, minds every bit as complex as any human psyche \u2014 or in some cases even more so \u2014 and these are the demonic intelligences known to Sleeper legend and mage experience. As emergent properties of the void itself, they remain ontologically antecedent to higher-order phenomena such as time and space, and so exhibit such qualities as non-local faster-than-light information transfer (telepathy, the Arcanum of Mind) and even the breakdown of space-like separation itself (teleportation, the Arcanum of Space). The hyper-dimensional vacuum is thus experienced as a riotous Pandemonium of ever-emerging wills-to-exist, combining to form more and more complex and energetic unified systems, demon lords that compete for power and seek to impose their existence upon the physical world through the superimposed waveforms of human thought.</div><div>This incessant activity of primordial interactions is perceived as the \u201cwailing\u201d or \u201chowling\u201d that other Mastigos call the \u201cGoetia.\u201d It is the same substrate from which all human (and other) thought emerges, the material of which all consciousness \u2014 according to Threnodism \u2014 is made. Goetia resounds in the private silences of the brain, where the firing of synapses between neurons can be heard as the conversation between demons in Pandemonium and in the outermost void of intergalactic space, where the shockwaves of creation yet echo. For the Threnodist, only a condensate of consciousness, energized by the scourge of critical inquiry and unified in the gauntlet of mathematic discipline, may listen to those strains and retain its identity. </div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Originally, only mages who Awakened as a result of their scientific studies were inducted into this Legacy. The academic prerequisites were so convolutedly arcane that these early purists seldom saw any possibly of synthesis between their own studies and the myriad esotericisms of willworking. For the first few decades of their existence, Threnodists saw themselves less as mages and more as members of the applied branch of the new theoretical physics. Tutors would not even accept pupils until they had submitted lengthy theses demonstrating their understanding of quantum mechanics.</div><div>Purists consider a solid understanding of advanced mathematics, physics and critical inquiry to be a prerequisite for any student. Formerly, this sort of training was available only to those with the financial means to choose the quality of their education. Broader historical trends culminating in the information age have made it increasingly possible for a less-moneyed person who is sufficiently motivated or gifted to acquire the necessary skills.</div><div>Not all Threnodic tutors accept pupils solely on the basis of scientific training. Some Wailers recognize that, just as the principles of quantum theory have much deeper existential and experiential roots, true understanding of those principles need not be confined to an educated elite. Despite academic objections, many of the characteristic elements of quantum theory can be understood intuitively, without intensive mathematical and scientific preparation. (Even tutors who subscribe to this view insist on some degree of training, however; second and third attainments are seldom taught to pupils without at least three dots in Science.)</div><div>One result of this increase in prerequisite latitude has been a covert search for intellectual prodigies, whether mathematical savants who can leapfrog over the stupefying calculations needed to ground quantum miracles in the solid bedrock of probative science or those who possess a simple intuitive capacity to visualize (or otherwise imagine) vague, complex and intangible microcosmic interactions. Such individuals are rare, of course. Also, such prodigious gifts may propel a mage to the heights of magical accomplishment but do not necessarily impart the moral wisdom that constitutes the highest degrees of true enlightenment.</div><div>Concurrent with this newfound latitude is a new trend that disturbs and even horrifies outsiders to this Legacy. Just as quantum mechanics introduced an element of madness into the \u201csanity\u201d of rational science, Threnodism now not only admits but actively welcomes pupils with clinical histories of mental illness. Of course, most practitioners of magic have traditionally been receptive to (and probably even originated) romantic notions of divine madness. Any willworker is likely to have a historical understanding of how childhood trauma was induced to create a shaman, or how the \u201cfalling sickness\u201d of epilepsy was taken as a sign of witchcraft. Even the most sophisticated, modern mage, however, can fall prey to the superstitions that still surround common cognitive dysfunctions. Many people equate neurological disease and psychological disorder with corruption, malice or some sort of spiritual deficiency. The documented existence of deranged but benevolent mages and rational Scelesti puts the lie to this view.</div><div>Threnodism points out that most criteria for sanity and spiritual wholeness rely upon an ideological framework of reason, order and almost mechanistic functionality. Quantum psychology, on the other hand, notes that consciousness retains an ability to cohere and to maintain an identity even in the absence of the aforementioned traits. Furthermore, some extreme forms of madness such as schizophrenia, multiple personality disorder and delusional paranoia actually appear to grant the sufferer keener insight into the quantum world, with the deep internal structure of the \u201cderanged\u201d psyche mirroring the greater external cosmology. Some Threnodists go on to say that this applies not only to Pandemonium, but to the entire Supernal World as well. Such pronouncements, of course, have done this Legacy no good in the eyes of mage society at large.</div><div>This said, the higher degrees of initiation still require the pupil to demonstrate a working knowledge of quantum theory and to apply its convoluted mathematical formulae to actual experience. Mathematical theory becomes the framework for interaction with quantum-demonic intelligences. Initiates who do not come from a scientific background might get this training in reverse order, learning scientific means of dealing with previous intrusions of the supernatural into their lives. Ultimately, however, attainments are not bestowed until some thesis \u2014 whether written or oral, theoretical or applied \u2014 is presented to a tutor, wherein the results of direct experience and experiment are synthesized with a formally codified system \u2014 which could be derived from sources as diverse as King Solomon\u2019s Goetia and Von Neumann\u2019s Die Grundlagen.</div>",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"<div>Being Mastigos, Threnodists naturally tend toward higher aptitudes in the Arcana of Mind and Space. This accords with their interpretation of quantum mechanics, wherein these two fields are held to be reflections of each other as the observer creates the observation. Most purists study Matter and Forces as well, as these were the original bases from which quantum theory emerged. Further elaborations led to theories concerning the nature of time that were hitherto only envisioned by experts in the Arcanum bearing that name.</div><div>With the increasing diversification of the eclectics, study of other Arcana has flourished. Use of the Life Arcanum in this respect has seen widespread activity, echoed by numerous pop texts on \u201cquantum healing.\u201d Heisenberg\u2019s probability matrices and Schrodinger\u2019s waveform equations are used to produce effects that can only be associated with the Fate Arcanum. Non-Boolean logic and fractal geometry has been applied to untangle the mysteries of Spirit. Prime has evoked exceptional interest, with the astronomical quantities involved in its calculation, but few Threnodists have attempted to deal with the dauntingly low amplitudes and frequencies that characterize Death.</div><div>During the heyday of the purists, Threnodic magic was heavily oriented toward bulky technological foci, which limited their more spectacular effects to laboratories equipped with lasers, particle accelerators, cloud chambers, crystal set radios, gigantic vacuum-tube computers and the like. In the \u201960s and \u201970s, transistor radios were popular among young eclectics who found the variability of the analog tuning system highly useful for manipulating the whole range of the electromagnetic spectrum. The revolution in digital technology has granted the modern Threnodist more mobility and discretion, focusing magic through cell phones, camcorders and laptops. One focus that has never gone out of style, however, is old-fashioned pencil and paper: With the Threnodists\u2019 reliance upon mathematics, all Threnodists learn to focus their will through an idiosyncratic script that uses barbarous names as terms in long complex equations and blends Minkowski and Feynman diagrams with Goetic sigils. Another tradition is the spoken invocation of the names and theories enshrined in the history of quantum mechanics, so that a Threnodist making magic sounds as if she were delivering an oral thesis to a board of professors. For quick spellcasting, Threnodists rely on little more equipment than their more traditional colleagues in magic, or none; the quantum demons respond less effectively to \u201cvirtual\u201d tools than to rarified equipment in a Threnodist\u2019s hands, but they do respond. For extended spellcasting, however, purist Wailers frequently retreat to laboratory-sanctums equipped with a full complement of scientific apparatus as well as a blackboard with lots of chalk.</div>",firstAttainmentName:"Superluminal Information Transference",firstAttainmentPrerequisites:"Gnosis 3, Mind 1, Space 2 (primary), Awareness 2",firstAttainmentDescription:"<div>One of the fundamental problems classical physicists had with quantum mechanics was its apparent violation of Einsteinian relativity, which dictates that neither matter nor energy may exceed the velocity of light, a fixed universal constant.

The mage may also employ the Mind 1 spell \u201cThird Eye\u201d to increase her own perceptual frequencies, enabling her to receive information from the more subtle ranges of the spectrum of magical energy.

Moore (one of Intel\u2019s co-founders) predicted that, at the perceived rate of technological progress, the number of transistors on a microchip would double every 18 to 24 months. He\u2019s been right for 40 years, and this theory was canonized as \u201cMoore\u2019s Law.\u201d</div><div>Some might say that this idea applies to all current technological and scientific development. Over the last century and into this one, progress looks truly exponential. In every field, whether robotics or pharmaceuticals, artificial intelligence or biotechnology, the evolution of human knowledge arcs upwards with an astounding curve. What humans have achieved during the last two millennia pales in comparison to what humanity has achieved during the last 100 years. And, in some fields, what humanity has realized in the last 10 years easily dwarfs everything of the last 100. </div><div>Enter the Transhuman Engineers. The mages of this Legacy believe wholeheartedly in the ever-accelerating growth of technology. They see the entire depth and breadth of history as a slowly gathering storm of possibility. The Fallen World has taken its time building steam to this level of raw potential, but that is how it should be. If a child accepts an allowance raise of a single cent that doubles every week, he doesn\u2019t see any significant growth for what feels like forever. But, as the weeks go on, he finds that, suddenly, his allowance skyrockets, and his meager piggy bank can no longer hold the sudden rise in his childhood income. In a year, this doubling allowance would bankrupt the planet. This world has taken a long time to get to here, inching forward step by step in its crawl toward development. But this is now the point at which progress is only just beginning. </div><div>With technology advancing in this way, the mages of this Legacy believe humanity will soon reach a point of Singularity. In mathematics, a singularity is a point at which calculation breaks down. A curve leaps to infinity. Technological singularity is the same, except here humankind\u2019s progress will grow to a point that nothing can stay the same and everything must change. Artificial intelligence surpasses our own. Lifespans stretch forever outward, granting everyone equal eternities. Flesh and machine merge. In this scenario, humans are no longer human, but post-human. </div><div>This is what the Transhuman Engineers want, and this is what they try to achieve. They know that other mages do not share the Engineers\u2019 view, but so what? The Engineers see themselves as the Prime Movers, the catalysts who push the envelope just a little bit further. They truly believe that they usher humanity toward the light at the end of the tunnel. The Engineers don\u2019t know what exists beyond the light. Is it another Atlantis? Something better? Will the Fallen and the Supernal Worlds reunite? Will all of the Sleepers have their eyes torn open? Will all things unite and become one? The Engineers don\u2019t know. They only know that they will help this to happen, and that everyone who stands in the way of progress is the enemy of a greater future.</div>",alternateNickname:"Prime Movers",orders:"The majority of Engineers come from the ranks of the Free Council, if they come from an order at all. The past is obsolete, so why cling to it? The process is forward. The future is key. The Prime Movers believe that technology captures a little bit of the Supernal. No one should waste time looking backward, and, hence, the Free Council and the Transhuman Engineers are an easy fit. It\u2019s the only fit, however. A few mages from the Mysterium join the growing numbers of Prime Movers. The mages who catalog and study the strange finds in the order\u2019s treasuries of lore sometimes feel attracted to the possibilities of this Legacy.<div>The other orders are less comfortable with the Engineers\u2019 mania for progress. The Guardians of the Veil, for instance, grow uneasy at the thought of \u201csharing\u201d magic or \u201cinspiring\u201d the mortal herd. Magic must be concealed, lest Paradox rear its head and power fall into foolish or unworthy hands. To the Guardians, the Prime Movers represent an open door \u2014 straight to the Abyss. Therefore, the Guardians feel themselves duty-bound to prevent the Engineers\u2019 chaos. The Guardians keep a close eye on the Prime Movers, waiting for the day the Guardians have to move in and \u201cfix\u201d the Engineers\u2019 egregious errors.</div><div>The Adamantine Arrow and Silver Ladder both think the Engineers are nuts. The Prime Movers want to change the world beyond recognition, rendering both orders pointless. For the Engineers\u2019 part, most don\u2019t care much for war or secret power: That\u2019s all so last millennium.</div>",appearance:"Transhuman Engineers see themselves as a progressive, driving force and tend to dress the part. Every mage interprets this in her own way, but most Prime Movers dress more ostentatiously than their counterparts on the Path of the Mighty. The Prime Movers favor power suits, loud outfits and haute couture fashions that call attention to themselves. A few Engineers parade around in garish makeup straight from cyberpunk movies such as Blade Runner, or adopt industrial piercings and unconventional tattoos (binary code, JavaScript, faux-circuitry). Prime Movers all love gadgetry, from iPods to PDAs, from lowgrade microchip implants to \u201csmart shoes\u201d; this gadgetry provides the surest guide to this Legacy\u2019s members.",background:"Transhuman Engineers can come from any race, creed, culture or income bracket within the developed world or advancing regions such as India. The only core tenet they all share is an unswerving interest in both technology and its effects upon culture. Anybody from a computer science student to a bleeding-edge pop culture blogger will do.<div>Most Engineers tend to be educated, and, thus, possess high Mental Attributes and Skills (especially Academics, Computer, Crafts and Science). That doesn\u2019t forbid these mages from being social creatures as well. They often act as the muses or false competitors for real inventors and scientists, and that takes the ability to understand and manipulate others, making Social Skills such as Empathy, Persuasion and Subterfuge common.</div><div>The Prime Movers share no common Awakenings, though many have claimed to \u201csee\u201d a literal singularity in their vision \u2014 meaning a point in which all things seem to merge and become one. Such a moment usually happens just before the mage finds herself in the Watchtower. Outside of that small feature, an Engineer\u2019s Awakening is as unique as anybody else\u2019s. </div>",organizzation:"The Transhuman Engineers have an informal organization. Although many mages of this Legacy like to stay in touch with each other to commune and plan, constant communication is not required. Once an Engineer\u2019s apprenticeship ends, he can choose to live the rest of his life without ever meeting with another Engineer. Few will condemn him for that.<div>That said, the Prime Movers do create opportunities for members to gather. The most important are the Legacy\u2019s \u201cExpos.\u201d Once a year, invitations go out (via e-mail or text message) to the various Engineers. They meet at a prepared and protected location and show off what they\u2019ve done and seen. Some Engineers create elaborate technical displays, whereas others hold a number of disquisitions and colloquia on any number of subjects \u2014 from medical nanotechnology to the artificial intelligence of upcoming video games. Other Engineers just sit in the bar and drink. Past Expos have been held on a hidden floor in the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, in the desert near Los Alamos, and in the tunnels below the Visvesvaraya Industrial and Technical Museum in Bangalore. At least a third of the Engineers do not come physically, but attend the Expos via some manner of telepresence.</div><div>The Engineers occasionally build communal citadels in the Obrimos fashion. They don\u2019t care for peaceful cloisters; innovation is not found in a vacuum. Prime Movers place their citadels where people and ideas gather and compete: in downtown city centers, on the most traveled highways and byways or among the throngs of students at huge universities. These places are the Engineers\u2019 war zones. Yes, nearby populations present risk, but these densely populated areas also the most fertile breeding grounds for raw possibility. The next generation of inventors, programmers and powerful minds won\u2019t be found wandering around a meadow. Such dynamic personalities will be in the thick of things, and so that is where the Engineers go, too.</div><div>Every Prime Mover has a favored area of technological interest or expertise, called her \u201ccrusade.\u201d A mage\u2019s crusade gives her a number of pet projects upon which to work. A Prime Mover whose crusade is portable computing devices might attach himself to an industry insider in an effort to inspire that individual. Or the mage might be the industry insider. Of course, an Engineer\u2019s crusade is by no means static, and can change without warning. Mages who share a crusade may form cabals, or simply work together from time to time to further common goals.</div>",suggestedOblations:"Convincing another person to try some \u201cnew\u201d tech, hacking a system you never hacked before, playing with a newly purchased (or stolen) \u201ctoy,\u201d reaching a hidden level or secret in a video game, ritually inscribing a favored tool with alchemical symbols, writing a computer program",concepts:"Early adopter, hacker, identity thief, inventor\u2019s muse, metrosexual philosopher, tech blogger, video game designer, war driver",historySocietyCulture:"<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>The Engineers are unexpectedly numerous for a relatively new Legacy. Their history, as such, is not particularly long. They do claim an unofficial heritage of various mages, however.</div><div>The Transhuman Engineers trace their heritage backward to various Free Council mages over the last century. These mages acted as muses to various significant figures of scientific and technological development and are said to have helped shepherd the destinies and inventions of paragons such as Nikola Tesla (genius of electrical engineering), Wernher von Braun (pioneer of rocket technology), Philo Farnsworth (inventor of the TV) and Allen Newell (originator of theoretical cognitive AI).</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>V.V.</h3><div>V.V. is the Free Council mage who first crafted his soul in an effort to help push society toward a technological singularity. He takes his shadow name from the initials of a prominent science fiction author whose novels and essays helped introduce the idea of the Singularity. The founder of the Prime Movers believes that the Fallen World is on the cusp of a technological singularity, and that forces conspire to keep the Fallen World from going further. By driving technology forward with compulsive devotion, the Transhuman Engineers can help bring the world to Supernal enlightenment.</div><div>V.V. is still around. Few mages see him anymore; he is rumored to be working on \u201csomething big,\u201d though precisely what it is remains a secret. Mages who\u2019ve worked with V.V. say he has a number of leading Sleeper scientists and inventors as his cronies, and what he is planning will change the world forever \u2014 one way or another.</div><div>V.V. leads a fluctuating cabal of mages young and old. Prime Movers consider it a great honor to be invited to meet V.V. and help him achieve his goals. Some mages who meet with him return to the world a month or a year later, wild-eyed with newfound enthusiasm for their crusades. Other mages do not return at all.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>While the Engineers have an informal (some would even say scattershot) organization, they still have a formalized culture. The Prime Movers endeavor to instill in their apprentices similar values, ideas and teachings. What these apprentices do with such lessons is up to them, but the Legacy considers it important that they all begin with a few shared precepts.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Action and Inspiration</h3><div>For mages who think about crafting their souls in the forge of this Legacy, it comes down to the simple question of what do the Engineers do? The Prime Movers don\u2019t require their mages to \u201cdo\u201d anything except support technological progress. That\u2019s it. Many mages ignore technology, or show contempt for it. The Engineers think this is short-sighted. Like it or not, they say, technology is the ladder upon which humankind climbs. To eschew technology means to forego progress. And progress is everything: it is the way the Fallen World will bridge the Abyss and reach the Supernal.</div><div>To the mages of this Legacy, progress means using technology and be seen using it. Many Engineers stay on the bleeding edge of technology. These early adopters buy whatever comes to market, no matter how expensive or impractical. If the product comes emblazoned with the hottest or weirdest technological buzzword, the mage probably wants it. Teraflops, telemedicine, bioinformatics, Bluetooth, pixel-shader effects, Turing tests \u2014 these are the words of the Prime Movers, and this language changes and grows daily. Owning the latest, gee-whizziest techno-toy is not mandatory. In fact, some Engineers cherish antiquated technology such as BBS\u2019s or ham radio. Slipping off the bleeding edge, however, does tend to reduce status within the Legacy.</div><div>Transhuman Engineers don\u2019t just use the latest technology. Some of them create it, too. A number of Prime Movers are themselves inventors, programmers or scientists. They try to push the limits of technology and magic alike. They imbue machines with magic; they use magic to further their scientific and technological research. (Of course, they realize that magic cannot be technology\u2019s sole component or driving force. Humanity must be able to harness and create technology for it to drive humankind toward the Singularity.) These mages do not work in isolation, and prefer to surround themselves with other mages, Sleepwalkers or even Sleepers who can contribute to whatever overarching design goal drives these Engineers. Engineers of this stripe are found in wildly varying fields \u2014 their crusades might mean helping map the genomes, building the world\u2019s largest Wi-Fi Internet-access \u201cbubble\u201d or helping to feed starving nations through biotechnology. No field is off-limits.</div><div>Still other Transhuman Engineers motivate and inspire their Sleeper colleagues. These mages become muses for the creators and architects of new technology. An Engineer could anonymously e-mail an inventor tips, tricks, insider information or even stolen or classified data. Alternatively, the mage could develop a close, personal relationship with the Sleeper. The Engineers often become friends or lovers to mortals they perceive as innovators like themselves. If this means buddying up to a video game designer with an interest in artificial intelligence, so be it. If it requires becoming lover to an inventor on the political and cultural fringe, then that\u2019s what\u2019s necessary. The Engineer can help shepherd the individual\u2019s progress, which might mean salving a damaged ego, leaving little \u201chints\u201d behind illustrating mistakes or corrupted data or helping to foster much-needed competition (for competition breeds progress).</div><div>For example, a Prime Mover might build an Enhanced or Imbued device that does something just outside the current range of expected technology. The device provides a feature or service that has long been sought after, but has not yet been achieved. Perhaps the Engineer offers a robot that can run (a long-existing stumbling block for inventors of bipedal robots), or maybe designs an engine that uses fuel more efficiently than anything in current production. The Engineer can show this \u201cprototype\u201d to a handful of Sleeper inventors (either by bragging about it or by purposefully leaving the specs where a Sleeper can find them) and say that, gosh, he sure hopes nobody beats him to market. With that said, the mage can stand back and let the competitive tech sector go to battle over designing the same or similar prototypes. What once needed magic becomes real. The Prime Movers say the trick has worked dozens of times.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Core Tenets</h3><div>Tutors of the Transhuman Engineers teach their apprentices the following tenets. An apprentice doesn\u2019t have to agree with these precepts, though open disavowal of them may earn her more than just a disgruntled look. More than one Engineer has lost status within the Legacy by mocking one or another tenet when other Engineers could hear.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Unopposed Progress</h4><div>Innovation cannot be opposed. People who block advances in technology are enemies of the Transhuman Engineers. The world moves toward an ineluctable point, a wonderful and necessary sublimation in which primitive humanity (i.e., the human race as it is now) becomes something greater, something different. Anyone who places roadblocks in the way of this objective is hurting the world. Such a person denies the Supernal. </div><div>Most Engineers take a subtle approach. If a pharmaceutical company deems a potential new drug non-profitable and tries to bury the project, an Engineer might steal the formula and give it to someone who will produce the drug. If a politician stands in the way of pro-technology or scientific legislation, the mage might dig up some dirt on the politico (an affair, an old DUI charge, a scandalous investment) and blackmail her into \u201cgoing with the flow.\u201d</div><div>Not all Prime Movers are so restrained, however. Some Engineers engage in acts that other mages see as dangerous or cruel. In the case of the aforementioned politician, the Engineer might forge evidence of a scandal (easily done with magic), threaten her or her family \u2014 or worse, simply assassinate or brainwash her. If a group openly opposes animal testing, even when such experimentation can save human lives, a Prime Mover might \u201cdissuade\u201d the group from further interference. It\u2019s regrettable if such dissuasion takes the form of coercion, torture or turning the members into lab animals themselves, but sometimes maintaining progress means making hard decisions. In this way, Engineers can become extremists as their Wisdom drops. Where once they might have taken a delicate tack in removing the obstacles of innovation, they eventually decide on more excessive (but \u201cnecessary\u201d) tactics to preserve the flow of information and advancement. </div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Unfettered Access to Technology</h4><div>Not only should progress remain unopposed, its benefits must be available for everybody\u2019s benefit. How can technology change the world if it stays in the jealous hands of an elitist few?</div><div>Many Engineers strive to expand access to modern technology. Why shouldn\u2019t the homeless have cell phones? Why can\u2019t a small African village connect to the Internet, have its own website and be entirely wireless? Whatever technology the Engineers possess, others should equally be allowed to have. In some cases, this means the Engineers purchase or steal technology, and distribute it among the masses like some kind of tech-obsessed Robin Hood. In other cases, the Prime Movers teach others how to pilfer their own tech. Perhaps the Engineers impart the secrets of hacking wireless networks or using peer-to-peer (P2P) pirate networks. The Engineers agree that the power of technology should be free, and one should make the utmost effort to keep it that way.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Anti-Corporate Attitude</h4><div>This Legacy upholds a somewhat counterintuitive \u2014 some might even say hypocritical \u2014 outlook toward corporations. Without funding from big companies, a lot of technological research just wouldn\u2019t happen. And yet, the Engineers still purport that corporations ultimately hurt advancement more than helping it.</div><div>The reason for this is that corporations are driven by their profit margins; any technology advanced by the corporations is geared toward their bottom line. How many possibilities have been pushed aside in the name of money? The corporations are not altruistic. They don\u2019t push the envelope based on humanity\u2019s needs \u2014 only the needs of their stockholders.</div><div>In fact, tutors in this Legacy teach their apprentices a number of corporate-level conspiracies. The pharmaceutical companies keep the cure for cancer hidden, because imperfect drugs and therapies make too much money. The oil companies similarly suppress the engines that run by splitting water molecules. The electric companies (in tandem with various world governments) keep Nikola Tesla\u2019s papers under wraps \u2014 not because he designed powerful weapons that could fall into the wrong hands, but because he designed technologies to deliver free wireless electricity. A number of Engineers claim they have proof of such conspiracies, though few will show the evidence to anybody outside the Legacy. (And, in the World of Darkness, of course, many conspiracies are true.)</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Technology Will Become Magic</h4><div>The Transhuman Engineers believe that true technology invites magic from the Supernal and enlivens the Fallen World. Occultist Aleister Crowley called magic \u201cthe art of causing change according to Will.\u201d The Prime Movers say technology fits that definition, too. As humanity controls the physical world more completely and more invasively through technology, brute matter becomes imbued with meaning. Technology, therefore, is the only part of culture (not art, politics or academics) that actively draws down and captures this mystery.</div><div>Modern technology comes closer than anything else to letting a Sleeper feel like a mage, too: will it, and it shall be so. Flick a switch, press a button or type a password and a thousand hidden forces and electromechanical djinni are at your command.</div><div>All of this ever-increasing knowledge and power converges in the Singularity. The Prime Movers believe the Exarchs won\u2019t be able to keep up with their Sleeping prisoners. The scientists will catch the Exarchs in their Lie and expose the secret, Supernal underpinnings of reality, the technologists will apply their discoveries and, thus, will the entire world be transformed.</div><div>Religion? Politics? Art? The Transhuman Engineers don\u2019t think those fields bring Supernal influences to the Fallen World. At best, religion, politics and art are amusements; at worst, they are deceits to propagate the Lie. Only technology can change the world.</div><div>In this way, the Prime Movers\u2019 views are very limited, and they clash sometimes even with the rest of the Free Council. Libertines acknowledge technology\u2019s power but do not focus solely upon it. The Engineers do.</div>",magic:"<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Magical Technology</h2><div>Prime Movers make frequent use of Enhanced and Imbued technological items. They even find a few Artifacts of technology that somehow captured Supernal power. An example might be an Imbued MP3 player that uses Forces and Space magic to pick up frequencies from across the world \u2014 or Mind magic to hear the thoughts of people nearby. Transhuman Engineers make heavy use of Enhanced items, which allow for subtle advantage out in the field (and the Engineers prefer to avoid Paradox for obvious reasons). Usually, an Enhanced item in the hands of a Prime Mover simply provides an equipment bonus toward its use \u2014 a laptop that gives a bonus when performing research, a cell phone that offers advantage when transmitting viruses to other cell phones or a Taser weapon that fires with unerring accuracy. </div><div>Prime Movers almost invariably dedicate technological devices as magical tools. (These often relate to an individual mage\u2019s chosen crusade). Any Free Council mage can do this as his order tool, of course, but Transhuman Engineers may dedicate high-tech Path tools, too. The device echoes a classic Path tool through its form or function: similar to a mirror, a picture phone captures an image; a Taser is as much a weapon as any spear or dagger. And what could represent an Obrimos mage\u2019s affinity for Forces better than a device that actually carries and manipulates energy through circuits and batteries?</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Gadget Acquisition</h3><div>Transhuman Engineers usually own a great deal of technology. It is not unusual to see a Prime Mover saddled with two iPods, a GPS device, wireless headphones, smart sneakers, a PDA, a keychain full of JumpDrives, a digital camera the size of a credit card, a handheld gaming device and a couple of different digital phones. Their sanctums are often similarly loaded with gadgetry: robotic \u201ctoys,\u201d kitchen appliances that connect to the Internet, LCD screens on every wall acting as windows, several PCs and so forth. Prime Movers often own a number of \u201cblack\u201d technologies (i.e., items that have yet to be mass-produced or announced to the public) such as stealth surveillance devices, transparent silicon circuitry, hologram monitors or biometric eye-scanners.</div><div>Such items are not only expensive but, in many cases, impossible to actually own. Some Engineers are wealthy, but few are wealthy enough to support their excessive \u201chabits.\u201d Transhuman Engineers don\u2019t always stay within the law. Mages of this Legacy are not only allowed to use magic to pilfer new technology, they are encouraged to do so. If progress is meant to be unopposed and available to all, the Engineers see little issue with taking it for themselves using the tools at hand.</div><div>The Engineers\u2019 overwhelming passion for technology can hobble them in some circumstances. They rely so heavily upon their gadgets that being without them is tantamount to total helplessness. Woe to the unfortunate Prime Mover who finds himself in the wilderness without GPS tracking, a digital phone and an air-conditioned weatherproof tent.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Vogue Tech</h4><div>While all technology is created equal in the eyes of the Prime Movers, some forms of tech are more \u201cin vogue\u201d than others:</div></div><div><b>AI:</b> Artificial intelligence is a crusade among many Engineers. In true AI, the mechanism would transcend itself and deterministic programs would become creative thought. Right now, two schools of thought compete for attention among the Prime Movers. One theory says that artificial intelligence should be made in the image of humans and that computers should learn to think with the free logic of which a human is capable. Other mages seek what is called \u201cemergent technology,\u201d in which the system intelligence is given the adaptability of an ant colony. While individual ants are stupid and capable of only the simplest acts, an entire colony performs complex feats of creation and survival. These \u201cmulti-agents\u201d might help resolve urban traffic flow, information retrieval, medical diagnosis, even pizza delivery.</div><div><b>Cyborgs:</b>  The Prime Movers have their share of cyborgs among them. A \u201ccyborg\u201d isn\u2019t a full-blown Terminator, but simply a human who has technology integrated into his body. Examples include pacemakers, tracking devices, microchips that monitor health and life signs and digital phone receivers planted in the ear. Some Engineers have \u201cenvironmentally reactive\u201d chips planted in the flesh of their arms. When an appropriately-fitted Engineer enters his home, the chip sends a signal to various parts of the house. Windows dim, lights turn on, coffee begins to brew or the house greets the mage in a pleasant voice.</div><div>Other mages conduct more radical experiments with chips implanted into their brains. With these chips, mages can control a mouse cursor or machine without touching it, because the chip allows them to do it just by thinking about it. Microchips in this fashion can also curb addictions and mental illnesses. So far, \u201cbrainchips\u201d all require enchantment \u2014 but the Engineers think their experiments will lead to devices that Sleepers can make and use.</div><div><b>Communication:</b> The last decade has seen an explosion of communication technologies. The two paragons of this technology are the Internet and the digital phone. With this one-two punch, the world can be informed of events nigh-instantaneously. If a bomb goes off in Berlin, a remote town in Alaska can hear about it (and see pictures of it) minutes later. The Internet similarly gives everyone a voice. All are free on the Net, unhindered and equal. (The \u201cblogger\u201d phenomenon is a perfect example of this, and one a number of Engineers join, as well.) The Engineers want to push these technologies until humanity has what amounts to a \u201chive mind.\u201d With the aforementioned brainchips, information can be relayed immediately through the global mind without hesitation or filter \u2014 someday.</div><div>Some other technologies and sciences (genegineered crops, cloning, medical tech) are regarded highly by the Transhuman Engineers but don\u2019t often make an appearance as a Prime Mover\u2019s crusade. While many of these technologies are touted as the \u201cnext big thing,\u201d most mages of this Legacy have a greater knack for \u201chard tech\u201d than these particular crusades. </div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Other Precepts</h3><div>The Transhuman Engineers follow a number of lesser \u201cguidelines\u201d that complement their overarching principles. These precepts are less likely to be followed with obsessive diligence, and instead provide a list of general characteristics that a mage in this Legacy might possess.</div><div><ul><li> Many Engineers complement their Forces and Prime Arcana with Matter magic. This enables their magic to control or create technology in almost any way they can imagine. </li><li>The Libraries of the Prime Movers are often more technologically byzantine than those of other Free Council mages. Engineers establish labyrinthine networks, each concealed behind firewalls, wireless access keys and biometric scanners. Some Transhuman Engineers spread their Libraries out over hundreds of DVD-ROMs or USB JumpDrives. Some Prime Movers actually make their own storage devices, items that others cannot understand to hack.</li><li>As Obrimos, the Engineers embody a kind of strength. They generally believe they are the only mages willing to guide the world toward its proper end (an \u201cend\u201d meaning \u201cnew beginning\u201d). They are used to conflict, and do not avoid it. That said, despite their strengths, the Legacy openly defies the usual organizations of the Obrimos. While some mages on the Path of the Mighty find a power in uniformity, the Prime Movers disagree. They believe that, as individuals, they unconsciously work toward a singular harmony. Forcing homogeneity breeds predictability, complacency \u2014 weakness, the Engineers suggest. Therefore, the mages of this Legacy are sometimes at odds with their Obrimos allies.</li><li>Despite relying upon technology, the Prime Movers are not without occult interests. In fact, they usually inscribe their tech devices with occult symbols. In addition to the Atlantean sigils common to all mages, the Engineers often draw upon astrology and alchemy \u2014 the precursors of physical science. Some cobble together their own symbols, often mashing together various alchemical symbols (for example, the symbol of gold with a lightning strike through it, to represent the microscopic gold wiring in every computer chip).</li></ul><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>It\u2019s not too hard to join up with the Prime Movers. For this reason, the Legacy has an unusually large number of mages in its ranks. A mage who wants to join the Transhuman Engineers faces only one test: impress me. That\u2019s all it takes, is to impress a current standing member. Of course, impressing a Prime Mover isn\u2019t easy, as many of them have seen it all (or believe they have). The nature of this impression is unique to each tutor. It can be as difficult and drastic as a mage showing how she podcasted from the top of Mount Everest. It can be as simple as designing a cool new GUI (graphical user interface) for a hip, pop culture website. What amuses and astounds one Engineer might bore another one.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Shadow Names</h3><div>When a mage crafts his soul in this Legacy, he chooses a new shadow name. Prime Movers often base their names on influential or revered figures of science or technology. (An Engineer usually picks someone who is dead out of respect, and also to make sure the Engineer doesn\u2019t get confused with the still-living individual; someday, they might be in the same room.) One Prime Mover might call herself Tesla (or merely Nikola), Edison or Einstein. Prime Movers also choose names of particularly visionary science-fiction writers (again, also deceased) such as Asimov or Heinlein. Other Prime Movers choose \u201cl33t\u201d hacker names, the names of technological products or titles of characters from tech-friendly pop culture (maybe the film Tron). The name generally reflects the mage\u2019s personality and his crusade. A mage devoted to non-linear emergent artificial intelligence might call himself Turing, since Alan Turing is perceived as the father of modern computer science and helped define the Turing test, a way of testing how well a program can truly mimic human behavior. (Alternately, a similarly-interested mage might name herself after a prominent computer game character in \u201chonor\u201d of artificial intelligence.)</div>",attainmentsDescrizione:"The attainments of the Transhuman Engineers are meant to help the mages push themselves and others toward the unknown future.

Such allegations can neither be confirmed nor denied, however, and only a scant few facts exist to corroborate the claims of the Fangs, or of the mages who condemn them.</div><div>What is known is that the Fangs derive some measure of their power from the acamoth and their Abyss-bound kin. In the eyes of most other willworkers, this offense makes the Fangs as bad as the Scelesti. After all, how much difference can there really be between bending knee to the Devil, and making use of his tools?</div><div>In truth, the Fangs of Mara make use of the darkest of magics, though not in the same manner as the Scelesti. Rather, the Fangs wrest their attainments from the restless dreams and hideous imaginings of the demon-gods, nightmares literally beyond any human comprehension. But why? Though known to but a handful of living willworkers outside of the Legacy, the Fangs aspire to the goal of using their knowledge to destroy those elder monstrosities and, perhaps, bridging the unfathomable gulf between the Fallen World and the Supernal.</div>",alternateNickname:"Nightmares",orders:"What little the orders know about the Fangs of Mara leads most mages to abhor them \u2014 but can tempt a few. Mages of the Mysterium regard fear as a product of ignorance. Still, some wisdom might be distilled from terror or some secret lore wrested from the dreams of the native entities of the Abyss. For mages of the Adamantine Arrow and the Silver Ladder, the promise of the Nightmares is especially tempting: the fear of one\u2019s enemies, and, potentially, critical (if cryptic) knowledge about the acamoth and the denizens of the Abyss. Of course, all but a handful of Arrow and Ladder willworkers turn away from the poisoned gifts of the Fangs, but a few succumb.<div>The Guardians of the Veil are the mages perhaps most likely to embrace the way of the Nightmares. Many Guardians are well-versed in terror tactics used to preserve the sanctity of the Mysteries. Mages in the most secretive Atlantean order can also fall prey to the romance of the hard choice and accept terrible stains upon their souls to serve some greater good. Such Guardians embrace their darkest fears, and those of others, in order to obtain the secrets they desire or to unravel the dark designs of the Abyss. Another sort of Guardian entirely is occasionally drawn to the Nightmares, one who has lost the way of Wisdom and has become a creature of the terror he creates in order to preserve the sanctity of the hidden world.\u2028The Fangs hold little attraction for the Free Council; what little the order knows about the Legacy inspires loathing, just as with most sensible mages. An unwary Libertine might seek out the Nightmares just to find out why other mages hate them so much, however, and so be ensnared.</div>",appearance:"Most Nightmares try to appear relatively normal (by whatever local standards apply). After all, they have enough to worry about in dealing with other willworkers without drawing undue attention to themselves from Sleepers. Other Fangs of Mara, younger and less experienced, put on what they perceive to be frightful trappings (theatrically sinister-looking clothing, menacing tattoos or piercings, even ritual scarification or other acts of self-mutilation), but most older Nightmares look down on that sort of attention-grabbing nonsense. Of course, more powerful Fangs tend to carry an aura of dread and unease with them, no matter how they attire themselves.<div>Fangs of Mara often have an unnerving quality in their stares, somewhat akin to that seen in the eyes of a hardened killer or someone on the brink of madness. Some Fangs develop nervous habits (or maybe tics), go gray at a young age or otherwise exhibit characteristics of longtime exposure to an unhealthy amount of fear. Some Nightmares lose their appetites and become gaunt, while others have nearly constantly accelerated pulses and respiration, and seem perpetually on the verge of \u201cfight or flight\u201d panic. A few Fangs become the archetypal \u201ccackling madmen,\u201d babbling to themselves (or to anyone that will listen) about, \u201cunspeakable terrors, roiling just beyond the edge of the mind\u2019s eye,\u201d and such. Aside from one or two disturbing qualities, though, most Nightmares seem ordinary enough to pass among Sleepers (or other Awakened).</div><div>Nightmares occasionally find their nimbuses twisted into terrible shapes, as the fear they hold within their souls twists the outward reflections of their Awakened power. Some Fangs manifest half-seen twisting tentacles curling around their bodies, while writhing shadows or hideous, demonic shapes loom around others. Odd tricks of space may surround a Nightmare, such as free-floating shards of a mirror or the warpage of a mirage, revealing unearthly vistas. There appears to be no rhyme or reason as to why this phenomenon happens to some Fangs and not to others.</div>",background:"Prospective Fangs of Mara are often people who have, in some way, worked with fear during the course of their lives, especially those to whom fear becomes both art and science. A crude and bullying bouncer at a nightclub revels in the fear he creates, but he wields it as a blunt instrument and has no appreciation for its subtleties. A psychologist who works with sleep studies, trying to unravel the chemical and psychological causes of nightmares, on the other hand, would make an attractive recruit for the Fangs.<div>Another type of potential Fang is someone whose Sleeping life was, at some critical juncture, defined by fear and who eventually learned to overcome it. A person driven into an institution after a mind-numbing trauma, for instance, and who later conquered the terror of that event, could well be sought out by the Nightmares. So could someone with recurring night terrors who finally won out over them through force of will, rather than medication. Confronting horror is important to the Fangs of Mara, and a person who understands her own fear is a step closer to mastering all fear.</div><div>Perhaps the least common of the \u201cdefault\u201d ways by which one comes to the attention of the Fangs of Mara is to survive an encounter with an acamoth or other powerful Abyssal being. People who do so come away with scars (both physical and psychological, though only the latter interests the Nightmares). Given the rarity of willworkers who actually clash with entities of the Abyss and live to tell the tale, however, these sorts of Nightmares form a clear minority of the Legacy\u2019s already-small membership.</div>",organizzation:"The Fangs of Mara are loosely organized at best, though the mentor-student bond is a powerful one. Given the fervor with which Consilii hunt the Nightmares (if the Consilii know one is near), the Legacy needs a widespread and decentralized organization to survive. Still, the ties between teacher and student, for good or ill, help to hold them together as adherents of a single, cohesive philosophy.<div>A Nightmare usually adopts a cellular structure. Each individual Fang knows his teacher and one or two others. More powerful adherents to the Legacy often know a few more members, but even the most well-connected Nightmare doesn\u2019t know more than seven or so others. In the rare Consilium in which the Fangs of Mara are not hunted (or, perhaps, hold sway, whether covertly or blatantly), this restriction is somewhat relaxed. Fangs from outside such Consilii, however, rarely associate with those within them. The Nightmares sensibly doubt the prospects of such a \u201cgood thing\u201d lasting forever and know the probable consequences when it eventually goes bad.</div><div>The Fangs of Mara have killed their own over potential threats to the Legacy as a whole. For instance, a powerful and influential Nightmare captured and delivered to a Consilium could expose a significant fraction of the Legacy to danger (or at least force the Fangs to flee their current lives). Such a thing is extremely uncommon, however. Few mages from outside the Legacy combine the knowledge, desire, mystic might and opportunity needed to effectively besiege an entire (deliberately scattered) Legacy.</div><div>Outside of the mentor-student relationship, the Legacy has no formal titles, no special forms of address or ceremonial gestures of obeisance made by one Nightmare toward another. Experienced and powerful Fangs simply command the respect they feel they are due, and can make their displeasure manifest upon irreverent younger Nightmares in many awful ways. For the most part, though, young Nightmares show honor to their elders. Such willworkers have seen things that would shatter most human minds, and many of them have indulged in acts of such splendorous fear and horror that would make even the most callous and jaded mental health professional cringe.</div>",suggestedOblations:"Writing in a journal of one\u2019s nightmares (or carefully scrutinizing and analyzing previous entries), indulging or confronting one\u2019s own fears, inducing fear or nightmares in another, engaging in a deep and meaningful discussion on the subject of fear, methodically researching the fears of another",concepts:"Prodigal psychiatrist, cerebral torturer, shellshocked veteran, dignified lunatic, long-term abuse survivor",historySocietyCulture:"<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>As one might expect for such a secretive Legacy, other mages can find little reliable information about the origins and history of the Fangs of Mara. The Fangs tell their students that the Legacy is very old, but even they don\u2019t know their origin. Anyone inside the Legacy or out who wants to learn more must follow slender clues found in manuscripts known only to the Awakened.</div><div>For instance, a 16th-century Greek willworker known only by his shadow name, Armenius, makes reference in his journals to the destruction of a thing that may or may not have been an acamoth. It was almost certainly an Abyssal being of tremendous power. He writes of \u201cthose wise in the Power, and sworn to the service of fear,\u201d as the mages responsible for the entity\u2019s demise. Armenius collected his account from the lone survivor, a ranting madman. Some scholars of obscure Awakened lore believe the willworkers mentioned were Fangs of Mara. Naturally, the entry invites some uncomfortable questions for other mages about what the Nightmares want. Nightmares who have read the account believe it describes a phenomenal success on the part of their Legacy. Armenius said only that the battle took place in the Black Forest of Germany. Attempts to find the battleground so the truth might be divined with magic have so far failed.</div><div>The first mage definitively identified as a self-proclaimed \u201cFang of Mara\u201d was a Silver Ladder willworker whom the Guardians of the Veil captured in London in the 1893. She had used her mastery of the mystic arts to pose as an inmate in a lunatic asylum. The Guardians caught her torturing the other inmates with terrible visions of fear, using them as studies into the tolerances of the human psyche. Under great duress, the captive revealed that she had intended to unleash the fruits of her research upon her rivals within the Ladder.</div><div>No other such reference would be heard (outside of the Legacy itself) until 1967, when a Guardian of the Veil living in Los Angeles, California, became the hollowed-out host for an Abyssal entity. After he was put down (at the cost of three mages\u2019 lives), the papers retrieved from his home mentioned the Fangs of Mara. The documents did not make clear whether the Guardian had pursued, or aspired to pursue, the way of the Nightmares. No Fang is known to have mentored him, but the ignominy of his demise was also poor incentive for any teacher to come forward and claim him.</div><div>Since that time, the Fangs of Mara have become, slowly but surely, known among certain scholars of obscure Awakened lore. The Fangs\u2019 appearances are always brief but always accompanied by horror. Few mages care to know much about them; some Fangs are amused by what they perceive as an \u201cignore it and it\u2019ll go away\u201d mentality. Then again, few mages have much opportunity to learn about the Fangs, anyway. Allegedly, the Fangs hide in the underbelly of Awakened society, recruiting from among infernalists with few scruples and an unhealthy fascination with the power of fear. Their critics say the Fangs are willing thralls to the acamoth and their kin in the unfathomable horror of the Abyss.</div><div>The Fangs themselves consider this a slander born of misunderstanding. While some Fangs of Mara quite probably are slaves to Abyssal entities, such Fangs are, given the Legacy\u2019s self-appointed task, in the minority.</div><div>In fact, Fangs of Mara occasionally drop a dime on Scelesti or other slaves to dark powers (Awakened or not) to cabals or even entire Consilii. Likewise, scattered accounts circulate of mages facing off against Abyssal horrors that were only defeated through the timely intervention of a Nightmare. The stories certainly aren\u2019t enough to make the Fangs seem trustworthy, but the Fangs in them do sometimes manage to seem noble, or at least a necessary evil. No willworker is concretely known to have slain one of the acamoth, but the Nightmares may represent the best chance the Awakened have of actually doing so.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>Fangs of Mara are ill received by most Consilii that know anything about the Fangs, and most of them are thus forever mindful to keep their true natures secret. Indeed, Nightmares are exceedingly wary of other mages who learn of their Legacy. Fangs do not react with immediate hostility and violence when other mages learn their secret, if they can help it. After all, the way of fear is perilously close to the path of the Scelesti. The Fangs know that one misstep separates them from mastering the acamoth and their ilk to being mastered themselves.</div><div>Fangs often avoid prolonged contact with one another, unwilling to accept the risk to what is a relatively small Legacy. The loss of three or five Nightmares is intolerably large by their reckoning, and so they stay in contact with one another through less direct means. Communication through dreams is a common tactic for them, and they establish and destroy the connections between their members (via the Space Arcanum) as needed, making it virtually impossible for outsiders to use one Fang to track down others. Particularly potent Nightmares convene during Astral sojourns in the Temenos, though the subjects discussed during these incorporeal gatherings remain unknown to lesser Fangs.</div><div>Teachers pass on to their students the arts of working strange magics upon the acamoth and sending messages through the dreams of such beings. Any mage who has undergone the \u201cNightmare Journey\u201d spell can use the Mind Arcanum to transmit messages to any other such willworker through the dreams of the acamoth. The Arcanum dot effects for such telepathic communication are as normal, but count as a \u201cFamiliar\u201d connection and cannot be traced by mages who have not entered the nightmares of the spawn of the Abyss. Given the medium of the missives\u2019 transmission, these missives are almost always tainted by disturbing and unearthly imagery, and unclean feelings. Individual Nightmares may know other magics worked on or through the acamoth, but these are not common to all Fangs.</div><div>Because of the Legacy\u2019s induction practices, many students see their teachers as tormentors and hold considerable enmity toward them, even long after the students have joined the Legacy. As a whole, the Nightmares consider this arrangement a good thing: it keeps the students sharp. So long as neither the teacher\u2019s nor the apprentice\u2019s personal issues escalate to actual violence, the Fangs don\u2019t usually intrude upon one another\u2019s student-mentor relationships. Fangs who do not endure such an adversarial relationship, however, often remain close to their teachers and are happy to maintain ties to wiser and more experienced Fangs. If at all possible, however, the Nightmares keep those ties at a distance. Only in places where one or two of them are powerful enough to hold secret sway in a Consilium (or, alternately, in the rare Consilii that accept them), do they begin to demonstrate any higher level of organization.</div><div>Under very rare circumstances, a Fang will find some small measure of acceptance in \u201cpolite\u201d Awakened society. Perhaps a particular Consilium has an exceedingly tolerant Hierarch or the Nightmare was a student or favorite of an influential Councilor before his induction. In such a case, an adherent to this Legacy can operate with reasonable safety. Slightly more often, an influential willworker understands the potential benefits from having civil, reliable, but secret, contact with a Nightmare. One never knows when the most intimate possible understanding of fear could come in handy.</div><div>The ultimate objective of the Fangs of Mara is so grandiose, and seen (by those few non-Nightmares that know if it) as such a colossal work of Hubris, as to make virtually any sane willworker see the Fangs as enemies. It takes an especially powerful sense of pride to imagine that any artifice of mortal magic could destroy the acamoth and their ilk (despite how much some mages want to believe).</div><div>The Fangs believe it, though. More even than their reverence for the power of fear, this objective \u2014 the overthrow of the lords of the Abyss \u2014 binds the Legacy together. It is the one thing they all agree upon. If the Awakened world paints the Fangs as villains because of that struggle, well, the Fangs will be vindicated in the end. History will remember them as the saviors that they are. At least, that\u2019s how the Nightmares see things.</div><div>The Fangs of Mara have less certainty about how to achieve this great work. Some of them struggle to decipher the fever-dreams of the acamoth, certain that unlocking their unholy wisdom is the surest path to obtaining the power necessary to destroy them. Other Fangs maintain that a shift in human consciousness as a whole, affected through the medium of fear, will harden even Sleepers to the terrors of the Abyss. The Fangs agree only that that the acamoth need human dreamers. Therefore, experimenting with nightmares may expose some critical weakness within the chthonic beings\u2019 seemingly unassailable power. </div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Nightmares tend to be drawn into their Legacy in one of two ways. The first way is a harrowing journey into fear, inspired by the would-be teacher without the prospective student\u2019s knowledge or consent. Terrifying dreams await her each time her head hits the pillow and half-glimpsed visions of horror dog her waking steps. Depending upon how she reacts to the \u201ctraining,\u201d she may be approached by the Nightmare, left broken in mind and spirit or eventually left alone. Fangs inducted through such means tend either to be of higher Wisdom than the other sort, or else of very low Wisdom (having been all but broken by the tender mercies of their teachers.)</div><div>The other common path to induction begins with the prospective student approached by the mentor, and encouraged to create fear and terror in others. Of course, only a mage who seems truly receptive to this notion is offered this opportunity, save by the most foolish Nightmares (and few of those sorts survive long enough to develop their own abilities, let alone pass on anything they learned.) The end result, ideally, creates a willworker monstrous and callous enough to adopt the philosophy of the Fangs of Mara \u2014 to embrace the tools of the enemy, so that those very tools might be turned back upon him.</div><div>Regardless of which road brought the new Nightmare to her Legacy, she is next made to enter into what may well be one of the greatest trials of her Awakened life. She submits herself to the \u201cNightmare Journey\u201d spell (see below), with the deliberate intent of encountering one of the acamoth and immersing herself in the thoughts and dreams of that chthonic intelligence. Once there, the mage either learns to master the nightmare imaginings of those dread beings, or is consumed by them. Some willworkers\u2019 bodies die with their faces contorted into expressions of purest fright, while others snap back to wakefulness, their minds shattered by the horrors they have witnessed. The Fangs lose about half of their prospective members that way, but the mages who survive with their sanity more or less intact are reborn, having harnessed the dreams of that which should not exist, and conquered fear thereby.</div><div>At each stage of growing understanding (as a Fang prepares to learn his next attainment), he again undergoes the \u201cNightmare Journey.\u201d Some say that each sojourn is easier than the last, as the spirit becomes inured to the agonies of looking upon such unadulterated monstrosity. Others claim that each successive journey is more difficult than the previous one, as more and more of the entity\u2019s attentions become focused upon a mind and spirit too small to easily weather such scrutiny. Still others find that the descent into the dreams of the unthinkable gets neither easier nor more difficult with time. It is, simply, what it is. Many Fangs prefer not to dwell overmuch on the subject, though. Some things are best kept locked away in the heart, even by mages who would learn to master horror from beyond space and time. </div>",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"The attainments of the Fangs of Mara reflect the unholy dreams and restless musings of the horrors of the Abyss.

Without that opportunity to heal and process what it has seen, the mind simply becomes desensitized to such terror.",thirdAttainmentOptArcana:"Space 4",thirdAttainmentOptDescrizione:"<div>By skirting the edge of the nightmares of the lords of the Abyss, where place and distance are meaningless, a Fang of Mara with Space 4 can project her mind into another person\u2019s Oneiros.

Dozens of students saw two of the world\u2019s leading masters of Time casting vulgar magic against each other.</div><div>None of the mages survived, body or soul. Investigators from the Guardians of the Veil recovered the bodies. The Guardians could only obtain glimpses of how the mages died. The investigators found a massive surge of Paradox and one clear image: a member of the Past Masters being slain by \u2014 himself (!)\u2014 but the other self carried a large pocket watch with a death\u2019s-head engraved on the cover. Behind them, the tattered edges of the world frayed into the Abyss.</div><div>Since then, mages who look like the deceased Mysterium mages and Seers have mounted attacks around the World of Darkness. They kill selected people (both mages and Sleepers), steal soulstones and Artifacts with powers of Time, Fate or Death, and destroy various objects, buildings and locations whose significance remains obscure. They cause a lot of Paradox in the process. Always, they carry the death\u2019s-head watches. One mage who survived a clash with these murderous and destructive dopplegangers learned a name: the Cult of the Doomsday Clock.</div><div>Worried mages have learned little about the Cult. The doppleganger-mages routinely use magic to block attempts to scry on them after the fact. Mages of the orders soon found, however, that the Cult seeks new members from the Moros Path. What\u2019s worse, the Cult sometimes locates newly-Awakened mages and brings them into its fold. In 2000, the Cult issued its first manifesto as part of a drive to attract new members. As the Legacy\u2019s name suggests, the Cult wants to destroy the world. Not just to destroy civilization, or humanity; they want to destroy the Fallen World in toto, material realm and Shadow Realm alike. Only then, they say, can the souls of mages escape the vile prison that is Creation and ascend to the Supernal World.</div><div>No one can imagine how the Cult of the Doomsday Clock could actually annihilate the world. But no one could have imagined a Paradox eruption creating evil twins of the mages involved, either. The more the orders learn about this Legacy, however, the more certain they are that the Cult must be destroyed \u2014 for every clue about the Cult\u2019s origins, masters and magic points straight to the Abyss.</div>",alternateNickname:"Tick-tock Men",orders:"All the orders, including the Seers of the Throne, hate and fear the Cult of the Doomsday Clock. The Seers suffer attacks by the Ticktock Men just as the Atlantean orders and the Free Council do. Besides, the Seers can\u2019t serve as the Exarchs\u2019 trusties if the Doomsday Clock destroys the world. Small numbers of mages from every order, however, have defected to the Cult.",appearance:"Doomsday Clock mages tend to dress in classic Man (or Woman) in Black style: black suit, white shirt, narrow black tie, black sunglasses. However, the suit jacket has large pockets on each breast with a chain hanging between them. One pocket holds the death\u2019s-head pocket watch, the other the counterbalancing fob. Cultists tend to accumulate timepiece or clockwork-themed Paradox brandings, such as hands of jointed brass or eyes turned into digital clock displays. ",background:"Doomsday Clock mages recruited from the orders share a great discontent with their lives and disappointment with the world. Some join the Cult out of grief or anger. Others join the Cult out of excessive idealism or spirituality: They long for the Supernal World so much they don\u2019t care what harm they cause to get there. Some people despise the world just because they didn\u2019t receive all the rewards they wanted. Such discontent can express itself through any Vice. Of course, mages found and trained by the Cult itself can come from any background.",organizzation:"Although the Cult is still very small, it observes a strict hierarchy. All members must supply the Cult\u2019s leaders with their true names and samples of their hair and blood, giving their superiors an Intimate connection for sympathetic magic of Time and Space. Any recruit can expect the Doomsday Clock\u2019s leaders to study his past and probable future.<div>Mages who join the Cult but do not yet qualify for the first attainment are Foliots. Members who possess the first attainment are called Hands. Foliots and Hands must obey higher-ranking members without question. The Cult does not like lower-ranking members to operate without supervision. A recruit who can hide her Cult membership may be asked to spy on her cabal, order and Consilium, but the Cult still insists that the recruit report to a superior every week or so. Most infiltrators are Foliots, since they lack the alterations to their souls that reveal Cult membership.</div><div>Cultists who reach the second attainment are called Tollers. The Cult trusts them to oversee missions and teach Hands and Foliots the Legacy\u2019s magic of Time and destruction. Tollers also learn some of the Cult\u2019s deeper mysteries and meet the Legacy\u2019s true leaders. Nevertheless, Tollers, too, are watched and never go more than a month without meeting with the Cult\u2019s senior members for thorough debriefings. Foliots and Hands may keep up the fa\xe7ade of mundane lives, but Tollers abandon such pretenses and devote their entire lives to the Cult.</div><div>After learning the third attainment, Cultists called Anachrons. These powerful mages oversee the Cult. Thus far, only a few recruits have joined the dopplegangers who emerged from the Paradox storm, but these converts are fully trusted by their colleagues. Anachrons take the most important missions, usually with Tollers or Hands as assistants.</div><div>The Cult\u2019s true leaders are the three Horae. These enigmatic beings never leave the Cult\u2019s headquarters, the Clocktower. The Anachrons frequently consult with the Horae; the Tollers see the Horae occasionally. Ticktock Men do not even learn the Horae exist until they graduate to being Tollers.</div>",suggestedOblations:"Causing death and destruction by disrupting a schedule or deceiving someone about the time (anything from tricking someone into mis-timing her medication, to reprogramming traffic lights), using Death and Prime to annihilate something completely, meditating on oblivion in a room full of clocks",concepts:"Watch repairman, occult kook, ascetic priest, libertine priest, efficiency expert, temp worker, computer geek, convenience store clerk, science fiction fan",historySocietyCulture:"<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>New recruits learn that the Doomsday Clock is just the latest manifestation of a tradition that dates back millennia. Always, a few mages and especially perceptive mortals have known the Fallen World was a prison for their souls. Buddhists rejecting the world, Jains starving unto death, the desert hermits and willing martyrs of early Christianity, Kabbalists who sought to see the throne of God \u2014 they all knew they did not belong in this world and were eager to leave it.</div><div>During all ages, mystics have tried to escape the Fallen World, but their attempts have all failed. After all, does anyone know a mage who actually, provably Ascended? No, the only solution is to destroy the prison. Burn it down from the inside! The souls of the Awakened will be purified and freed to return home.</div><div>During the late Hellenist period, mages associated with certain Gnostic cults believed that if they could study the flow of Time in the world with greater accuracy, they could find the flaws in Time and force them open, creating an escape route from the cosmic prison. These Gnostics studied the movements of the sun, moon and planets in search of gaps in Time. When mechanical clocks were invented in Europe, a new generation of mages used them to search for subtler flaws in Time. The mages found the flaws, and realized that the instruments used to measure time could control it \u2014 and destroy it. These mages became the founders of the Cult of the Doomsday Clock.</div><div>Sometimes, recruits hear that the Cult did not exist before 1997, and appeared in a massive Paradox manifestation. The recruits\u2019 tutors compliment them on their perspicacity. The Exarchs, as the creators of Time in the Fallen World, try to erase the Cult from history \u2014 not just knowledge of the Doomsday Clock, but the members themselves, changing history so members never joined the Ticktock Men. The leaders of the Cult, however, wield enough power to protect themselves from these attempts. When the fabric of Time rips in massive Paradoxes, the Ticktock Men can return to history. They\u2019ve done it before; some Anachrons have lived in two or three alternate histories before this world.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Penetrating the Mask</h4><div>Much of the Cult\u2019s story does not jibe with what the orders teach about the origin and history of mages, and for a very good reason: the Cult\u2019s story is a pack of lies. The doppleganger-mages who appeared on July 17, 1997, are not mages from an alternate history. They are creatures of the Abyss, literal Things From Beyond hiding in human form \u2014 and the mages they recruit become creatures like them.</div><div>Such abominations cannot be persuaded, tricked or tortured into giving away what they really are. They would rather die. They even think false thoughts for other mages to read. Only determined and powerful Mind magic can rip aside the mask of humanity (however twisted that humanity may be) to find the inhuman monster. Perceiving the true thoughts of a Doomsday Cult leader requires the Mind 4 spell \u201cRead The Depths\u201d (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 215) which further must penetrate a Mind 3 \u201cMental Shield\u201d (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 208) with a Potency of 3. This special Mental Shield exists only to protect the false mage\u2019s true inhuman thoughts but is active all the time, even when the mage is asleep or unconscious.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>Humans don\u2019t run the Cult of the Doomsday Clock. This is the Legacy\u2019s deepest truth, and the truth the Cult most wants to hide. Even the most fanatical humans develop disagreements, get tired or make exceptions. The Anachrons don\u2019t. They agree on everything. Their zeal never flags. They really, truly want to destroy the universe and will do or say anything to further that goal. Most of what a Doomsday Cult member learns is a lie designed to draw her further into the Cult.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Recruitment</h3><div>Just as any cult or radical group, the Doomsday Clock needs some way to attract new members. The Cult has two problems in this respect. First, the leaders of every order condemn the Doomsday Clock and want to destroy it. Second, the Cult\u2019s doctrine is blatantly insane. </div><div>The first problem is simply an inconvenience. Consilium leaders and order luminaries tell other mages not to read the Doomsday Clock\u2019s manifestos, but the leaders can\u2019t stop anyone. If a mage really wants to spread a message to other mages, he can do it, and even maintain his own secrecy. Methods can range from broadsheets in Atlantean stapled on telephone poles to cockroaches programmed to type out messages by jumping around a keyboard. Many mages will read the manifesto just because they wonder what their seniors don\u2019t want them to know.</div><div>The second problem is not as great for mages as for Sleepers. From personal experience, mages know the universe of common sense and Sleeper perception is a Great Lie. Annihilating the universe doesn\u2019t seem quite as crazy when you know a whole other Supernal World exists. Some mages find the Fallen World distasteful enough, or the Supernal World alluring enough, that they can seriously consider destroying the one to reach the other. Ninety-nine out of 100 mages read a Doomsday Clock manifesto, think it\u2019s claptrap and throw it away. The 100th mage \u2014 wonders.</div><div>Doomsday Clock manifestos lay out the basic doctrine that the Fallen World is a trap for mages\u2019 souls. Mass Ascension requires annihilating the Fallen World. Without the ballast of matter and spirit dragging them down, souls can rise to the Supernal World and the Exarchs won\u2019t be able to push them down again.</div><div>Mages who want to learn more can go to various web pages or mail-order tracts with material in both everyday languages and High Speech. Of course, everything is sanitized of sympathetic ties that could lead back to Cult members. A mage who finds this further information attractive can ask for a meeting with a Ticktock Man.</div><div>Cult leaders expect attempts to trap recruiters. Hands and Tollers covertly investigate mages who ask to meet the Cult, looking for evidence of treachery and to assess the mages\u2019 characters. If the applicants seem sincerely interested, the Cult tells the mages to appear at a certain time and place \u2014 then visits them somewhere else, earlier, and whisks them away for active recruitment.</div><div>The Doomsday Clock uses standard cult techniques to mold the thoughts of candidates. Interested mages attend retreats in which they only associate with Foliots and Hands, all directed by a Toller. The Cultists drum in the message that the world is evil and only transcendence from it is good. The Cult has canned answers for most questions and doubts about its doctrine. Cultists never use magic on a candidate. The Cult\u2019s leaders know that magical brainwashing can backfire, or leave traces that other mages can detect.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Trial Membership</h3><div>Candidates becomes Foliots when Cult officers decide the recruits sincerely want to join. Doomsday Clock recruits all start as Foliots, even if they have the Gnosis and Arcana to become Hands.</div><div>First, Tollers skilled at Mind magic examine the candidates\u2019 thoughts in depth, searching for any hint of treachery. If applicants cannot trust the Cult in this, the Cult certainly has no reason to offer trust in return. The induction happens in one of the Cult\u2019s minor sanctums. The recruits sign their true names on slip of papers while Hands snip off a lock of the recruits\u2019 hair and draws an ounce of their blood into a small phial. The presiding Cultist (usually a Toller) places these three items inside a grandfather clock bearing symbols of the Arcana and Watchtowers.</div><div>The presiding Cultist tells the recruits they have sealed their destiny to the Doomsday Clock for all time. If they try to leave, or betray the Cult\u2019s secrets, this Doomsday Clock shall toll the recruits\u2019 final hours.</div><div>The clock at this ceremony is imbued with auras of Death, Fate and Time, but it doesn\u2019t have any real powers; it just looks impressive. Later, an Anachron uses the sympathetic links to perform divinations about the new Foliot\u2019s future loyalty, as another check against mindaltered spies and cowards who might turn on the Cult. The signature, blood and hair are also kept in case sympathetic magic becomes necessary in the future. Once a mage becomes a Foliot, her contacts in the Cult (never more than one Toller and three Hands) encourage her to draw back from other associations, both Sleeper and Awakened. The Cultists take the Foliot on more retreats, where she is further catechized in the Cult\u2019s ideology. Her handlers teach her whatever Arcana and Skills she needs to qualify as a Hand and serve the Cult, from Science to Subterfuge. The Foliot also receives small missions as tests. Her handlers closely examine her performance. When the Foliot\u2019s supervising Toller believes the Foliot knows the necessary Skills and Arcana, and has proven her loyalty, the Toller arranges for full induction into the Legacy. For the first time, the new member visits the Cult\u2019s headquarters \u2014 the Clocktower.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Clocktower</h3><div>Individual Cultists may create their own sanctums, but the Cult itself has one special magical stronghold. The Tick tock Men call it the Clocktower. New members are told that the name pays homage to the Watchtowers. The Anachrons know the name is a challenge. Hands are told the Clocktower touches the Supernal World. Actually, the Clocktower exists in a pocket of space and time within the Abyss. The Clocktower is, indeed, a realm of its own, with powerful enchantments that Cultists may call upon, and it follows laws different from those of the material world or the  Shadow Realm.</div><div>From the Clocktower, a Cultist (or any mage with at least Time 4) can open a door to anywhere on Earth. This door is made of polished iron, carved with a clock face overlaying a large hourglass; the engraved hands of the clock visibly move. The door can appear in any wall where a normal door already exists. Only mages with Time senses can see the Clocktower\u2019s door, though: the Clocktower and its doorways never exist in the now. They are always three seconds in the future. To pass through the door without assistance, a mage must possess the first attainment of the Cult, or use the Time 4 spell \u201cTime Stutter\u201d to jump at least three seconds ahead in time when he grasps the doorknob. Anyone who doesn\u2019t meet these requirements steps through an ordinary door, to the ordinary place on the other side. Cultists call these doors Escapements, since the Cultists use them to get away after missions (or if missions go wrong). </div><div>Inside, the Clocktower is an Escher-like maze of impossible perspectives. Stairways form closed loops with no beginning or end. Every window looks out on another room or hallway of the Clocktower, possibly turned at right angles or upside-down. Angles are sometimes concave, sometimes convex. Everywhere, there are clocks or parts of clocks: wheels of numbers or digital readouts, swinging pendulums and pulsing springs, gears and escapements, sundials and hourglasses. Some clocks run too fast or too slow; some run backwards (even the hourglasses and water-clocks), or their hands move at random. </div><div>The Clocktower holds the Cult\u2019s Library of magic lore, chambers where members can practice their spells, briefing rooms for planning missions and comparatively ordinary living quarters. One section holds a maze where the walls shift every few seconds. To traverse this maze, you need to know where the walls and open passages will be in the future; thus, only mages with temporal perceptions can solve this labyrinth. The center holds the Clocktower\u2019s heart, the cathedral-like hall called the Aenigma Temporis. Time is deeply out of joint in the Aenigma Temporis, speeding, slowing and reversing without rhyme or reason. Here, the three Horae hold court, seated before the pendulum of an enormous clock with three randomly turning hands and a blank dial. The cabinet of the giant clock bears the ominous clich\xe9, \u201cIt Is Always Later Than You Think.\u201d</div><div>Every visitor can find his own image in the hall\u2019s stained-glass windows. The windows shine as if there were a sunny day outside. Anyone who breaks a window, however, finds the dark horror of the Abyss on the other side.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Magic in the Clocktower</h3><div>In the Abyssal realm of the Clocktower, members of this Legacy gain a +2 bonus to all Time magic. Anyone else suffers a \u20132 penalty to spells and rotes using that Arcanum because of the warped flow of time. In the Aenigma Temporis, Anachrons and Horae receive the further advantage of a continuous Time 2 \u201cGlimpsing the Future\u201d effect (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 259), enabling them to roll twice for one instant action every turn, and take the better of the two rolls.</div><div>All magical senses are \u201cwhited out\u201d in the Aenigma Temporis. The mystical forces are too disrupted by the Paradox of the place\u2019s own existence to reveal anything else. Anachrons and Horae are immune to this effect.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Operations</h3><div>As specialists in Time, the Cultists of the Doomsday Clock plans for the future. Many of the Cult\u2019s operations are designed to forestall or create some future possibility that sends the Fallen World closer to the Abyss.</div><div>Every eruption of Paradox frays the fabric of reality a little more, so Doomsday Clock members don\u2019t worry much about causing Paradox. This necessarily means a greater likelihood of branding. For Cultists, branding usually has a clock or temporal theme, ranging from part of the body looking incongruously aged (or young) to a limb transforming into still-living structure of jointed metal and clockwork. </div><div>Sometimes the Cult works stealthily to acquire lore and magic that may help in future acts of destruction. The Cult especially seeks soulstones and Artifacts. Soulstones let the Cult enslave other mages as thralls and are used to build Demesnes. Artifacts charged with Death, Time or Prime may provide clues to unmaking reality. The Cult also seeks mystic lore as assiduously as any other magical group, in hopes of finding ways to wreak destruction more completely and on a vaster scale. </div><div>Quite often, though, the Cult must act openly and violently. For instance, acquiring soulstones usually means attacking the mages who created a Demesne. Ticktock Men also attack cabals to loot their Libraries of any Artifacts they possess.</div><div>The Sleeper world comes in for attack as well. At least once a year, the Cult murders a Sleeper for no apparent reason \u2014 at least, no reason the Sleepers can see. The orders feel sure the Cult kills Sleepers who could oppose its plans in the future. For instance, a child destined to become a great diplomatic peacemaker could put a crimp in the Cult\u2019s plans for mass destruction. A murder or the destruction of a building might also change another person\u2019s destiny, making him more likely to become angry, despairing or otherwise more likely to choose a path that brings destruction to the world.</div><div>Finally, some atrocities are tests and training. Mass destruction \u2014 or even universal destruction \u2014 may sound easy in the abstract, but a person who thinks she\u2019s a hardened badass or resolute idealist might choke when asked to bomb a crowd or cut a child\u2019s throat. The Cult gradually leads recruits to more brutal and ruthless deeds. No Cultist becomes a Toller without committing coldblooded murders and other sickening atrocities. Not only can such people never leave the Ticktock Men without admitting their guilt to themselves, such vile deeds lower a mage\u2019s Wisdom and, therefore, make Paradox eruptions last longer, for a more severe erosion of reality.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Doomsday Clocks</h3><div>The Cult\u2019s name is more than just a poetic figure of speech or a reference to their pocket watches. The Anachrons build actual Doomsday Clocks. These magical devices destroy an area. Fire or bombs seem destructive enough to Sleepers. But, to the Cult, such destructive devices merely change the form of matter. The Cult wants complete annihilation \u2014 a bit of reality gone forever.</div><div>Each Doomsday Clock works only once and is difficult to produce, so the Cult cannot use these infernal devices as often as the Cultists would like. Some Doomsday Clocks destroy material objects; other Doomsday Clocks kill the living or disrupt ephemera. The Cult\u2019s ultimate goal is to build a Doomsday Clock powerful enough to unmake the entire Fallen World. No mage can imagine how they might do this \u2014 but no mage who has seen the effect from a little Doomsday Clock can say it\u2019s categorically impossible. This, above all, explains the fear the Cult inspires.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Sample Doomsday Clock (Imbued Item \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022)</h4><div>Durability 3, Size 2, Structure 5</div><div><b>Mana:</b> 12</div><div>A Doomsday Clock looks like an old-fashioned clock, small enough to fit into an attach\xe9 case. The Clock\u2019s case is made of polished black iron with lead trim. Instead of numbers, however, the Clock\u2019s dial carries cryptic sigils known only through studies of the Abyss.</div><div>This particular Doomsday Clock destroys every object made of normal matter within 32 yards. The Clock does not destroy \u201cextraordinary matter\u201d such as enchanted items, supernatural materials such as thaumium or matter that carries an extra \u201ccharge\u201d of meaning, such as gold or diamonds. Sometimes that isn\u2019t a bug, it\u2019s a feature: Cultists can disintegrate a sanctum with the assurance that any Artifacts, soulstones and other magical objects will remain undamaged \u2014 and easy to loot.</div><div>The Clock carries two spells that \u201cfire\u201d at once. The first consists of the Matter effect, \u201cAnnihilate Matter\u201d (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 201) raised to Matter 5 for a combined spell; this also lets it affect an area. The Clock combines this with a Time 4 effect, \u201cErase History\u201d (described below). Nothing destroyed by the Clock can be scried later using Time 2 \u201cPostcognition\u201d (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 260) or other spells to look back in time. That means anything destroyed by the Clock is truly gone forever, with no chance that a mage could look back in time and re-create it \u2014 true, total annihilation. Doomsday Clocks raise this effect to Time 5 for a combined spell, area effect and advanced prolongation (to erase a destroyed object\u2019s temporal traces back to its origin). The spells require lots of successes to annihilate large areas \u2014 but the Cult includes several masters of each requisite Arcanum, and they use every trick to ease the accumulation of successes in an extended casting.</div><div>Each round, the Clock expends one Mana and projects the combined spells over its area. As damage accumulates from repeated uses of \u201cAnnihilate Matter,\u201d first small objects disappear, then large objects, walls and even the ground underneath. At the same time, \u201cErase History\u201d renders everything in the area impossible to see through temporal magic, reaching back through time: a few minutes before the clock struck, an hour, a day.... If the Doomsday Clock tolls enough times, the area\u2019s entire history becomes impossible to scry. After expending the last point of Mana, the Clock itself disintegrates. Once the Clock strikes, the only way to stop it is to destroy it. Because the Doomsday Clock works only once, its cost is reduced by one dot.</div><div>No one but the Anachrons and Horae know how to build the Doomsday Clocks. It cannot be easy, because the Cult does not use the enchanted clocks very often.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Horae</h3><div>These powerful Abyssal entities created the Clocktower and sent the doppleganger-mage Anachrons into the world. The Horae cannot enter the Fallen World themselves, so characters are not likely to encounter them anywhere but the Clocktower. </div><div>Horae look like black, hooded monastic robes draped over unseen figures. Two gearwheels spin where eyes should be, and hands of jointed brass emerge from the sleeves. The Horae wield powers of Time and Death comparable to master mages. The Horae have other vast powers, too \u2014 they apparently created the Clocktower \u2014 but, in a direct confrontation, they use Numina that duplicate Time and Death rotes.</div><div><b>Rank:</b> 4</div><div><b>Attributes:</b> Power 10, Finesse 10, Resistance 10 Willpower: 20</div><div><b>Essence:</b> 25 (25 max)</div><div><b>Initiative:</b> 20</div><div><b>Defense:</b> 10</div><div><b>Speed:</b> 25</div><div><b>Size:</b> 5</div><div><b>Corpus:</b> 15</div><div><b>Influence:</b> Death 5, Time 5</div><div><b>Numina:</b> Horae can duplicate any rote based on Death or Time.

If one of these creatures is forced into the Fallen World, the Hora tears apart and vanishes, leaving a Timebased Paradox anomaly. If forced into the Abyss, an Hora expands into a huge, menacing phantom and vanishes, but reappears in the Clocktower a scene later. If all three Horae are destroyed, the Clocktower crumbles within minutes.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Initiation to the Legacy itself comes once a Foliot meets the requirements for the first attainment and has proven his loyalty through some deadly betrayal of former colleagues. An Anachron brings the candidate to the Clocktower. The candidate proves his readiness by negotiating the maze to the Aenigma Temporis. In that zone of twisted time, the candidate\u2019s own future self helps the mage craft his soul to achieve the first attainment. At least, that\u2019s what it looks like to the candidate. Any Anachron or Toller can guide the soulcrafting; the Cult uses an illusion of the candidate\u2019s older, future self as another stratagem to convince the Cultist he can never leave \u2014 because, apparently, he hasn\u2019t. Or maybe it\u2019s no illusion at all. In the Aenigma Temporis, it\u2019s impossible to tell. The experience points normally tithed to the tutor pass to the Horae instead, so it doesn\u2019t matter who actually initiates the new Hand. The initiate receives his death\u2019s-head pocket watch and becomes a field agent for the Cult.</div><div>A Doomsday Clock cultist receives the second attainment in the material world, outside the Clocktower. The nascent Toller repeatedly invokes \u201cShifting Sands\u201d (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 263), replaying the same moments but acting differently each time, until she causes a Paradox. Instead of quelling the Paradox, the new Toller must embrace it.

Not so after the third attainment. This ceremony takes place in the Aenigma Temporis. The Horae guide the nascent Anachron in scrying his own past, right back to his Awakening \u2014 and then he attacks and kills his past self, making his very existence a Paradox. Once again, maybe this is just an illusion, or maybe it\u2019s not. At the moment when the Cultist invokes his own nonexistence, the Horae finish his soul\u2019s transformation.

When a Cultist wants, she can make time shiver and swirl around her. She, and objects in her immediate vicinity, speed up and slow down from moment to moment, and even seem to move backwards for fractions of a second. One part of the Cultist may be accelerated while another part of her body slows. This makes the Cultist more difficult to hit and reduces the force of any attack that succeeds. The result is exactly like the Time 2 rote, \u201cTemporal Dodge\u201d (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 261). The Cultist gains one point of armor per dot she possesses in the Time Arcanum.</div><div>Time Out of Joint is not a covert effect, though: the mage\u2019s herky-jerky movement looks deeply wrong. Even Sleepers can see this (though they usually Disbelieve what they see).</div><div>Doomsday Clock initiates also possess an innate sense for the passage and manipulation of time, such as the Time 1 rote, \u201cTemporal Eddies\u201d (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 258) \u2014 but only for an internal clock and to register the use of other Time-based magic (including the Cult\u2019s own attainments).

This attainment mimics the Time 3 effect, \u201cShifting Sands,\u201d (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 263) except Bid Time Return does not require any sort of dice roll. Undoing history still costs the Cultist a point of Mana, though.</div><div>Bid Time Return makes Ticktock Men into incredible tacticians. A Toller can try one course of action, then jump back and try again if his first choice was wrong \u2014 so long as he lives, and still has Mana to spend. For example, a Toller could take a turn out of combat to wedge a door shut, right before his enemy\u2019s reinforcements were about to run through it. The moment the reinforcements burst in, the Cultist realized blocking the door mattered more than launching his last attack, so he rewound the last turn and did that instead. Bid Time Return doesn\u2019t guarantee victory, for the new choice may bring consequences of its own. In this example, the Toller gives his opponent a chance to attack him without a response; his actions to block the door might even make him easier to hit.</div>",secondAttainmentOptArcana:"Death 4",secondAttainmentOptDescrizione:"If a Ticktock Man also possesses Death 4, his ability to Bid Time Return is not limited by death.

Off the Clock resembles the Time 4 rote, \u201cSeven Breaths in an Instant\u201d (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 265), even to using the successes from a Wits + Occult + Time roll to set the ratio between external time and the Anachron\u2019s personal time. A Ticktock Man can also make time run more slowly for her, however, so an hour can seem to pass her by in minutes. For instance, with three successes, a Cultist could spend one hour Off the Clock while 15 minutes pass in the wider world, or spend 15 minutes Off the Clock while the rest of the world sees an hour pass.</div><table border='1' style='margin: 15px 0;'><thead><tr><th style='padding: 5px;'>Time within Pocket</th><th style='padding: 5px;'>Target Number</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style='padding: 5px;'>x2( faster or slower)</td><td style='padding: 5px;'>1 success</td></tr><tr><td style='padding: 5px;'>x3</td><td style='padding: 5px;'>2 successes</td></tr><tr><td style='padding: 5px;'>x4</td><td style='padding: 5px;'>3 successes</td></tr><tr><td style='padding: 5px;'>x5</td><td style='padding: 5px;'>4 successes</td></tr><tr><td style='padding: 5px;'>x6</td><td style='padding: 5px;'>5 successes</td></tr></tbody></table><div>Anachrons can use Off the Clock to rest, recuperate or prepare ritual spells.

That is why it exists in all times and places, adapting to the signs and legends of every society. Ironically, this has not given Legacy members a common purpose. In fact, they are some of the most fractious mages alive because they are devoted to their kin and community over other mages \u2014 including other Dreamspeakers.</div><div>The idea that magic is primarily a secret, intellectual practice is foreign to the mindset of the Legacy. Sleepers have known Primals for what they are ever since the first of them learned to communicate with the Dream. Dreamspeakers claim to have been the first mages and, among all others, closest to the original purpose of the Awakened. Other mages call the Dream \u201cAstral Space,\u201d and describe it as a place entirely separate from the rest of the universe: a kingdom of souls where powerful men and women can erect their own temples of fancy. Dreamspeakers believe this is an arrogant, ignorant and dangerous worldview.</div><div>According to the Legacy, the whole Dream was once an intrinsic part of human existence. Hunters couldn\u2019t kill their prey unless they knew its place in the Dream, and to learn anything, a respectful person needed to walk the Dream until they found a place where that lore played itself out in living myths. Most importantly, the Dream\u2019s inhabitants were the creators and rulers of the world. Long ago, they walked the physical world, living out epics that the Dreamspeakers preserve through their oral teachings. After a time, the Dreamborn grew bored or tired with creation. They retreated to the deep Dreamtime where they were born.</div><div>Mysterium anthropologists have their own theories about the Dreamspeakers, but Primals pay those mages little heed. Drawing from Sleeper theories, mystagogues believe that a Dreamspeaker learns to communicate with the deepest parts of her own consciousness. These regions are inextricably linked with the Astral Plane, extending beyond personal dreamscapes into the primordial symbols of human consciousness. Mystagogues believe that Dreamspeakers learn to extend the Awakening into the so-called primitive regions of the brain,  such as the limbic system, Dreamspeakers find this unlikely because, to the Dream existed before humanity. Human dreams reflect the Astral Dream, not the other way around.</div><div>Dreamspeakers believe that the potential to join their Legacy is almost always innate. Men or women with the fire of the Dream must join the Legacy or live in madness, unable to understand why they are plagued by visions and voices. Although some mages risk their sanity to open this potential within their souls, this is not seen as a particularly laudable thing. After all, every Dreamspeaker has a purpose outside of his own enlightenment.</div><div>Self-discovery isn\u2019t the point. Instead, a Dreamspeaker is conscious of a side of the universe that few people know of, and is obligated to act as a mediator between the Dream and the physical world. He teaches his people about the Dream, and they, in turn, ask him to represent them there. Legacy members rarely accept anyone who is unwilling to meet this obligation. In the past, they almost never accepted anyone who wasn\u2019t already destined to join them, but in the modern age, many Dreamspeakers have realized that they belong to a broader cultural movement that\u2019s in danger of being swept away by modern, materialistic values. That\u2019s why the Legacy has opened itself to initiates from the Free Council.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Dreamspeaker Shamanism</h3><div>Dreamspeaking is not the only form of shamanism, and the Dreamspeakers know this. Primals believe that the term \u201cshaman\u201d denotes an arbitrary grouping of mages with little in common besides a place apart from the world\u2019s monolithic religious institutions. A few respect the term as far as it applies to anthropology, or as a description of the Thyrsus Path. In the latter context, Dreamspeakers know that many shamans focus on the Shadow Realm. Such mages believe that it represents the truth of a living universe, where every object has a corresponding spirit. Dreamspeakers agree that the world is alive and full of the diverse children of the Dreamborn, but hold that the Dreamborn themselves \u2013 not their raucous, competitive offspring \u2013 are the world\u2019s wisdom keepers. </div><div>Consequently, while Dreamspeakers are fully conversant in the Spirit Arcanum and the lore of the Shadow, they cultivate a strictly utilitarian relationship with Shadow spirits. These spirits deserve respect, but not worship. Even though Shadow beings hold the essence of this world, they are locked into the roles that the Dreamborn made for them. But only the Dreamborn know why the universe is ordered as it is. Dreamspeakers respect the Dreamborn for this secret lore. Other shamanic ways are useful, but not as profound.</div><div>Dreamspeakers have few traditions in common, but one is that their Legacy is almost always the predestined vocation for a few, special individuals. People chosen by the Dream experience what the uninitiated might call a psychological breakdown. Future Dreamspeakers suffer \u201cdelusions\u201d (actually secret knowledge) and \u201challucinations\u201d (visions of the Dream). A Legacy tutor teaches initiates to understand their experiences and use them as magical aids. Without a tutor, an initiate\u2019s life usually falls apart, though there are rare stories about the Dreamborn themselves initiating mages.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Dreamborn</h3><div>The question of whether the Dreamborn have always existed, created themselves or are the offspring of an even more powerful order of beings is answered differently by the various Dreamspeaker groups. When Dreamspeakers from different cultures meet, they don\u2019t consider the question to be very important. Instead, encountering the Dreamborn in the here and now, and searching for the signs they left within the world form a shared focus. The nature of the dreamborn isn\u2019t really fit for cold analysis. They simply are, and by human reckoning, always have been the true parents of Creation.</div><div>The original Dreamborn dreamed the universe into existence in story cycles and poetry. When their task was complete, they withdrew into their own realms. In the Fallen age, they might be slumbering even more deeply than when they dreamed the world. Alternately, they may have \u201cawakened\u201d into a place where no shaman can go. There, beyond the deepest Dreamtime, they might be gathering the power to remake \u2014 or destroy \u2014 all the realms. Dreamspeakers versed in Atlantean traditions believe that the Supernal Realms are these deep dreams or forbidden places. Spells call the Dreamborn into the world to unleash their creative powers. Dreamborn breathe, eat and excrete power, and have no more control over where it all goes than a person can command the location of every stray hair or footprint. This is why ignorant mages can steal some of this power, using it without honoring its source.</div><div>In legends, a few humans have become Dreamborn. The first man and woman are almost always thought to be among these legendary. So are powerful Dreamspeakers and heroes. The first person to make fire was probably one of the Dreamborn. Although great deeds vault a person into the ranks of the Dreamborn, these heroes are never envied. According to myth, most of them lived anguished lives. Elder Dreamborn hated those brave (or arrogant) enough to steal divine powers. Fire and the secrets of healing plants were holy secrets until ancient heroes uncovered them. These heroes won divinity inside the Dream, but not before suffering the wrath of the Dreamborn that made the world.</div><div>It\u2019s also common for Dreamspeakers to become minor Dreamborn. These deified shamans watch over their own Lineages. A few modern Dreamspeakers also claim they\u2019ve met historical figures in the deepest Dreamtime. These phantoms are common enough in the astral shallows, but finding them in the depths proves that they\u2019ve become one with the great archetypes of Dream. Whether or not people such as Albert Einstein or Mao Zedong still live as Dreamborn is a controversial topic.</div>",alternateNickname:"Primals",orders:"Dreamspeakers are mostly indifferent to the orders, and for the most part, the orders return the favor. Only the Free Council fully accepts the Legacy. Free Council mages are intrigued by the Dreamspeakers\u2019 claim to ancient, truly universal human magic. The order rarely demands anything from its Dreamspeaker members, leaving them to follow their own Paths and work within the communities they prefer. Some Libertines almost venerate the Legacy as free spirits who have never truly submitted to the Atlantean ideology. To these Libertines, the Dreamspeakers represent an unconquered, enduring magical tradition.<div>The Primals have always resisted the Lie, and in return, they have borne the brunt of oppression from urban religious movements and colonization. Libertines come into the Legacy looking for the \u201coriginal magic,\u201d or to experience cultures they feel haven\u2019t been as tainted by colonizers and conquerors. Free Council Mastigos often join the Dreamspeakers to better explore their own, traumatic Awakenings. Some Mastigos slide right from the terror of the Mastigos Mystery Play to the Dreamspeaker initiation, suffering utter madness until they find the Dream. </div><div>Adamantine Arrows often find the Dream. The Primal way is filled with tales of violence, blood and magical oaths. Arrow Dreamspeakers channel warrior myths into reality, calling Dreamborn to possess them and drive them to excellence. As skilled healers, Dreamspeakers also provide support for Arrow war bands. Dreamspeakers who combine their unique skills with more straightforward martial abilities can quickly rise to the top of the order\u2019s political structure. These elder mages create warrior societies with their own rituals. A Primal usually inducts mages and Sleepers into such groups without prejudice. The Primal calling drives him to find members from outside Awakened society. If he is a warrior, then he\u2019s compelled to teach a warrior\u2019s lessons to all who require them. </div><div>A Guardian of the Veil who hears the Dream\u2019s call might suffer a crisis of faith. Guardians hide magic from Sleepers, but Dreamspeakers share magic. They counsel their communities about the role of the Dreamborn in their lives. Reconciling this duty with the Guardians\u2019 ethos requires careful judgment. Primals know that some secrets should stay buried, but not to the point of leaving Sleepers too ignorant to live in peace with them. As a compromise, Dreamspeakers can induct their communities into the Guardians\u2019 Labyrinth (see Guardians of the Veil and Mage: The Awakening, p. 46). Such Dreamspeakers teach their own tribes and families special initiation rites. These Dreamspeakers teach their followers to respect the Dream without revealing its most dangerous secrets.</div><div>Dreamspeakers have a chaotic relationship with the Mysterium. On one hand, the order respects enduring traditions, but there\u2019s a fine line between knowing the ancient ways and stealing from them. Many Dreamspeakers hail from cultures that have had their fill of priests, government officials and social scientists taking their artifacts and teachings. Nevertheless, Dreamspeakers are devoted to secret knowledge, too. A skilled Primal needs to know all the names and signs the Dream leaves in the world. Mystagogues who find their calling within the Legacy don\u2019t compromise their own ways of knowing for the sake of conventional academic biases. This turns out to be extraordinarily useful. Once freed of these conventions, the Primal can interpret evidence in ways her colleagues might never consider.</div><div>The Legacy\u2019s relationship with the Silver Ladder is an odd case. No other order suits the Primals\u2019 social roles better, but the th\xe9archs are obsessed with Atlantis \u2014 a place Primals consider to be little more than a waypoint in the Dream. Still, there are those who believe that the Dream must come back to an Awakened Nation. The Dreamspeakers never rejected Atlantis, but when it fell, it became another teaching tale. For this reason, Dreamspeaker th\xe9archs are powerful community leaders who are especially devoted to social cohesion and moral lessons. If the Awakened Nation is to rise again, it mustn\u2019t turn into another tale of fools and power.</div><div>Finally, it should be noted that there are Dreamspeakers who are not a part of any order. These apostates hold to no higher organization than their own community. They respect their initiation Lineage and no other. As medicine workers for their people, they believe that the grandiose politics of the Awakened world are distractions. Some Dreamspeakers even believe that outsiders pollute the Dream and should not practice magic at all. </div>",appearance:"Dreamspeakers prefer a practical style that favors their own cultural affiliations and personal Dreams. The stereotypical Primal has initiatory scars or tattoos, but these are merely symbols of his social ties. The Dreamspeaker values these, but not as much as the invisible mark of his calling. Still, the power of the Dream can leave many outward signs. Personal taboos can change a Dreamspeaker\u2019s body language and speech; he might avoid walking in a straight line or will never directly name a thing that figures strongly in his Dream.<div>Dreamspeakers often feel called to manipulate their gender identities by cross-dressing or affecting an androgynous style. A Dreamspeaker who is a skilled Life mage might use magic to change her sex. Because Dreamspeakers unlock the secrets of their own psyches, most learn to accept elements of their sexuality others might deny or ignore. Among other things, this means that Primals may play with gender as a form of magical symbolism, as a means of expressing their own sexual identities or both.</div>",background:"Dreamspeakers claim to represent the most primal tradition of magic. It existed before Atlantis and unless the Lie utterly crushes the human spirit, will survive after every other Legacy dies. The calling has always existed, but initiates must decide whether they are crazy or ready for the Dream.<div>This Legacy is less of a discipline than a calling. Most mages become Dreamspeakers because they feel as if they have no choice in the matter. They suffer what might be called a spiritual crisis, a psychotic break or both. Primals believe that it\u2019s a choice between initiation and madness. As such, members can come from virtually any background. Nevertheless, mages familiar with cultures that revere spiritual healing are more likely to find tutors.</div><div>Initiates who belong to such a traditional culture are among the most sincere guardians of their community\u2019s political autonomy and religious customs. After they experience the first throes of Awakening and \u201cmadness,\u201d their tutors tell them deep secrets. These include creation myths unknown to the uninitiated, the names and characteristics of the Dreamborn, and oral histories that include tales of hidden times and places. Outsiders who hear these stories might find Atlantis in the words and signs \u2014 but then again, they might not.</div><div>Outside of these communities, Dreamspeakers\u2019 backgrounds are often irrelevant to their current concerns. A successful lawyer Awakens. His Art leads to a string of legal victories \u2014 until the Dream calls. He abandons his successful practice for the wilderness 100 miles away from his office. A young woman\u2019s parents treat the Dream as if it were an illness. They institutionalize her, dimming the Dream with drugs until a tutor discovers her potential. </div>",organizzation:"Communities determine how Dreamspeakers organize. A Primal learns the cultural signs of a community from his tutor, establishing a Lineage of common beliefs and practices. Dreamspeakers who share a tradition band together into medicine societies. These groups share secret signs. When members of a Dreamspeaker community encounter an unfamiliar mage, they subtly determine whether or not the outsider knows them. If she does, she is a possible ally, but if she doesn\u2019t, she might be a threat to the community. Dreamspeakers often shun or ward against these mages, even if the outsiders are other Dreamspeakers.<div>Still, there is a growing movement among Dreamspeakers from different backgrounds to ally based on their common values. This movement is a few centuries old; roughly half of the Legacy ascribes to it. The other half either is split between those who believe that they should integrate with the Pentacle orders and those or who isolate themselves from outsiders completely. Isolationists are not always xenophobes, but believe that they must stand apart to preserve the purity of their traditions. It\u2019s a serious concern, because other mages have used medicine society secrets to pose as allies of a community. The problem has a parallel among Sleepers, where \u201cWhite Shamans\u201d profit from indigenous beliefs without giving anything back. Mages who infiltrate Dreamspeaker communities with similar strategies have been known to abuse the secrets of the Dreaming for their own benefit.</div>",suggestedOblations:"Drumming or listening to drums and other rhythmic instruments. Dancing. Physical ordeals, such as suspension and controlled strangulation. Isolation in a sacred place.<div>Dreamspeakers also use specialized drugs. Anthropologists call these natural preparations entheogens (derived from the Greek for \u201cgod within\u201d). The scientific community has only begun to categorize these drugs, since many of them are prepared from exotic plants. Medically, they are usually categorized as hallucinogens, even though the Dreamspeakers who use these drugs would not characterize states induced as unreal. In contemporary urban environments, Dreamspeakers make use of a number of more common legal and illegal drugs.</div>",concepts:"Fringe anthropologist, psychologist, charismatic preacher, tribal healer, ecstatic oracle.",historySocietyCulture:"<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History</h2><div>The Dreamspeakers have no founder and no common history. Instead, each tutor/initiate Lineage has stories that tell the Dreamspeakers why they have entered the Dream, where it will take them and what their responsibilities are. Some legends even say that the very first humans were Dreamspeakers. These humans understood their place in the Dream and talked to its denizens without the need for special rituals.</div><div>This is not to say that the Dreamspeakers know nothing about Atlantis. Thousands of legends talk about the Awakened Nation and the hubris that destroyed it. Dreamspeakers say that they existed before Atlantis and despite their indifference to the place, led the first mages there. Their stories describe the rise of new sorcerers, each of whom held to some new, grandiose philosophy. Their ambitions exceeded the bounds of their own communities, so they warred with each other and with members of the Legacy. Dreamspeakers defended their communities ably until the Dream itself signaled a change. </div><div>The \u201cdragons\u201d that led the way to Atlantis were Dreamborn. Sorcerers outside of the Legacy couldn\u2019t understand their visions, but the Dreamspeakers could. Primals cemented the first alliance between the Legacy and outsiders because Primals divined the will and path of the Dreamborn. This assured the Dreamspeakers a distinct place in Atlantean society. A shadow of this role existed in later cultures. Japanese miko and the Delphic Oracle recall the role of Dreamspeakers in Atlantis. They relayed the Dream to priests and sorcerers who had lost touch with its primal nature. </div><div>In time, the lords of Atlantis forgot why they enshrined the Dreamspeakers. Primals relayed the warnings of the Dream without success, because the populace believed that the Dreamspeakers\u2019 utterances were nothing more than a ritual for the mad. When the Dream made it clear that Atlantis would fall and the people wouldn\u2019t listen, the Legacy abandoned the city.</div><div>Atlantis fell; the Dreamspeakers returned to smaller communities. They never rejected civilization, but did not think urban cultures were necessarily superior. Whenever they followed their people to lives in a city or nation, they found that these places repeated the folly of Atlantis. Once the people embraced abstract philosophies and distant gods, they stopped listening to the Dream. </div><div>This is why the Legacy\u2019s oldest Lineages exist among tribal communities. Such cultures never lost sight of the Dream. On the other hand, Dreamspeakers still dwell in the middle of urban life. The Dream calls to people no matter where they live. Isolated from the roots of Dreamspeaker cultural practices, these initiates justify their experiences within mainstream religions. Dreamspeakers find their way into Christian congregations and Buddhist temples. According to legend, a few Legacy mages can\u2019t trace their initiation back to a mortal tutor, leading some to speculate that ancestor spirits or even the Dream itself taught them. Modern Primals sometimes claim they were Dream-initiated in order to demand respect from their fellows, but to put it diplomatically, this is usually only true \u201cfrom a certain point of view.\u201d</div><div>Unfortunately, the Legacy\u2019s universality contributed to a widening gulf between medicine workers who lived in small traditional communities and those who adopted burgeoning empires. Colonial civilization suppressed the eldest Dreamspeaker lines by destroying their cultures. Ironically, \u201ccivilized\u201d Dreamspeakers were sometimes at the forefront of conversion and destruction efforts. In North America, aboriginal medicine workers and zealous Christian evangelists were the two most common pastimes of Dreamspeakers. To this day, elder medicine societies will rarely admit that they share a Legacy with the evangelists. The exceptions see organized religions as a place to divert would-be \u201cWhite Shamans,\u201d so they can follow the Dream without stealing traditional lore.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2></div><div>Dreamspeakers are cautious around outsiders. Most Dreamspeakers follow cultural traditions that warn them of the black magic and evil practices of foreign mages. Furthermore, Primals have seen that it is their fate to be marginalized within ambitious, expansionist cultures. This makes them reluctant to participate in modern Awakened society. On the other hand, the Legacy is not mired in the past, and individual members do join conventional cabals. </div><div>Most Primals assess outsiders based on how they treat the local community. Mages who harm and manipulate a Dreamspeaker\u2019s people are enemies to be driven off and killed. In this respect, the Legacy has no patience for Consilium dictates or the supposedly universal Lex Magica. A single incident can earn the longstanding enmity of a Dreamspeaker band. </div><div>On the other hand, not all Dreamspeakers are benign healers and counselors. A few prefer a more ambiguous role. Their charges know that they can harm or heal. Fearful communities learn to shower these Primals with gifts to avoid sickness and disasters. The Legacy sees no common ground between peaceful and threatening members; they kill and confound each other almost as often as they do outsiders.</div><div>One of the most distinctive aspects of the Legacy is the way they skirt customs that require them to hide the Mysteries.</div><div>A dreamspeaker\u2019s people usually know that he can perform miracle. This is, after all his purpose \u2014 the very reason the community supports him. This is the primary reason why so few Dreamspeakers join the Guardians of the Veil. However, Dreamspeakers almost never practice obvious magic in front of Sleepers. Dreamspeakers know that witnesses not only offend the Dream, but risk their own sanity when they see its uncloaked power.</div><div>A Dreamspeaker\u2019s community is so central to her existence that it bears some additional discussion. In most cases, the community has been served by Legacy members for as long the community has existed. There are specific rules within the society that govern how members treat the Dreamspeaker, including protocols of address, marriage (some communities give the Dreamspeaker preferential treatment; others forbid it) and who may succeed her.</div><div>Dreamspeakers can join the Legacy without finding a community to support them. In such cases, the Primal reaches out to find people who accept him, as there seems to be an instinctual need to become a part of a community. Some conservative societies may view him as a raving heretic; others accept his eccentric, influential presence. In the last century, it\u2019s often been the case that new Dreamspeakers choose a place in Awakened society, adopting a Consilium as their own community. Even so, a Dreamspeaker serves in his own way, and doesn\u2019t feel especially bound by political concerns.</div><div>It begins in anguish. The initiate suffers a mental breakdown characterized by hallucinations and extreme emotions. Most mages have already experienced an event like this during their Awakening, but for a potential Dreamspeaker, the breakdown runs even deeper. Other mages learn to accept and absorb the mad spark of Awakening. Dreamspeakers do not; the visions, symbols and strange encounters never stop for long. If a potential Dreamspeaker sees this as a disease, he may look to psychiatry and drugs, but they won\u2019t help. If he doesn\u2019t seek initiation, he may spiral into drug addiction, institutionalization or suicide. Some even accept that Awakening is a disease. They become Banishers.</div><div>More experienced mages can also suffer a Dreamspeaker\u2019s spiritual crisis. The crisis may take the form of persistent Paradoxes, derangements or traumatic Astral journeys. If they can find initiation, they learn to accept these afflictions as parts of the Dream. Indeed, they may turn these experiences into lessons that strengthen the rest of their lives.</div><div>Finally, sometimes mages with stable psyches want to become Dreamspeakers. Such mages often believe that the Mysteries are overly intellectual, or have been obscured by politics and unnecessary rituals. Many Free Council members join the Legacy to sever all of their ties with the politics and myths of magic. They crave direct experience over study. They get what they wish for, but it doesn\u2019t come without a price. This form of initiation is the hardest of all, because the initiate\u2019s tutor must force open the gates of the Dream. This process can require physical ordeals, psychoactive drugs and extended Astral journeys.</div><div>A Dreamspeaker tutor is capable of distinguishing between mere madness and the call of the Dream. Sifting through visions and dreams, he discovers whether or not the initiate\u2019s distress is caused by her own mind or messages from the Dreamborn. If a tutor finds signs of the Dreamborn in a prospective initiate\u2019s thoughts, he knows that she\u2019s been chosen.</div><div>The tutor intuitively compares these signs to his own initiation. During the last century, with so many Dreamspeaker communities recovering from colonial crimes, tutors sometimes found it necessary to search slums and hospitals for initiates. Traditional wisdom is in such short supply that many potential Dreamspeakers never identify the true source of their anguish. Tutors sometimes find it necessary to cure their charges of drug addictions, spring them from prisons and psychiatric hospitals, or extricating them from dangerous associations with drug dealers and abusive family members.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Who Is a Dreamspeaker?</h3></div><div>All Dreamspeakers suffer psychological trauma as part of their initiation, but this doesn\u2019t mean that the Storyteller should inflict a nervous breakdown upon a character to force him into this Legacy. Joining the Legacy is not necessarily the character\u2019s choice, but it is always the player\u2019s choice. This means that the player and Storyteller should work out the details of the initiation. Storytellers should indicate whether or not they\u2019ll allow the character to join the Dreamspeakers, and players should discuss the way they\u2019ll portray the mages first exposure to the Dream.</div><div>In game terms, a Dreamspeaker initiate always uses Arcane Experience to pay the first experience point stipend to his tutor. Here are some (but not all) of the ways in which he can acquire this Arcane Experience.</div><div><b>Astral Travel:</b>  An Astral journey that forces the mage to confront the deepest parts of his consciousness, or one that features the Dreamborn, can provide suitable Arcane Experience.</div><div><b>Derangements:</b>  Characters who explore the magical significance of a derangement gain Arcane Experience they can spend on becoming a Dreamspeaker, even if the derangement is cured (by raising Wisdom). Suggested methods include casting spells to satisfy the derangement\u2019s urges, examining spirits drawn by the resonance of the mage\u2019s psyche or even confronting spirits representing the derangement on the Astral Plane.</div><div><b>Paradoxes:</b>  Paradoxes that reflect the mage\u2019s psyche can provide the insight needed to join the Legacy. Manifestations often take their shapes from a mage\u2019s hopes and fears, while Branding can turn flaws in the mage\u2019s soul into visible physical afflictions.</div><div><b>Tutors:</b> The process of finding and studying under a Legacy tutor is probably the easiest way to acquire the necessary Arcane Experience, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s too easy. Just meeting the tutor isn\u2019t enough; he has to set the mage to arduous tasks that force her to question assumptions about herself and the universe. Tutors have set initiates on dangerous treks through the wilderness or city\u2019s sewers. They\u2019ve forced initiates to hunt powerful spirits and have demanded other intense, soul-testing activities.</div>",magic:"<h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>New Merit: Dreamland (\u2022 to \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022)</h4><div><b>Prerequisite:</b> Awakened, Dreamspeaker Legacy </div><div>Effect: The mage may freely visit one or more locations in the Dreamtime. These Astral locations arise from the psychic resonance associated with a place.</div><div>Some Dreamspeakers say that the Dreamborn came to rest in such places, and that Dreamlands are the echoes of the Dreamborn\u2019s own fitful dreams. Others say that ancestors won these places from the Dreamborn at the dawn of time, or that they merely arose after millennia of rites and initiations in the sacred place. Dreamspeakers can know multiple Dreamlands. Each one represents one Merit dot. A character does not require this Merit to reach a Dreamland, but he cannot access its wisdom without first purchasing this Merit.</div><div>Each Dreamland contains one dot of the Library background (see Mage: The Awakening, pp. 85\u201386). This usually doesn\u2019t represent Astral books and scrolls, but visions of wise ancestors and Dreamborn who are willing to share their knowledge. This lore can often reveal histories \u2014 both mundane and supernatural \u2014 of the region that are otherwise unrecorded in any book or living memory.</div><div>Drawbacks: Dreamlands are at least 20 miles apart from one another. Each Dreamland\u2019s physical location also has one essential feature that, if destroyed or changed (by construction or landscaping, for example), cuts off access to the Dreamland until the problem is repaired. </div>",attainmentsDescrizione:"Dreamspeaker Attainments focus on understanding what most mages would call Astral Space. Dreamspeakers call it the Dream. They hold that it is not as disconnected from the physical world as most mages believe.

Accordingly, this Attainment enables Dreamspeakers to enter a waking trance that lets them sense the Dream and ordinary reality simultaneously.</div><div>Dreamspeakers with this Attainment can enter Astral regions without losing sight of the world. In effect, the Meditation roll to initiate Astral travel becomes an instant action that the character\u2019s player may roll once per turn (rather than the usual 30 minutes per turn) until she reaches the desired Astral Plane. She does not need to be within a Demesne or Hallow to do this.</div><div>Once she reaches an Astral Plane, the Dreamspeaker can simultaneously perceive Astral and Material Realm phenomena; she can see and move through both regions at the same time. But aside from movement and perception, she must choose whether to act in one place or the other on any given turn. Phasing into one realm or the other (the Astral or the material) requires an instant action, after which she can act in that realm while continuing to perceive both realms. In all cases, however, her physical body remains in the Material Realm, and others in that realm can interact with her even if she is busy interacting with the Astral Plane. Witnesses who don\u2019t know what she\u2019s up to might believe her to be some sort of madwoman, pantomiming actions and speaking with non-existent beings. </div><div>If she is attacked by Astral beings while she is phased into that realm, she suffers Willpower damage per the normal rules for Astral combat. If she loses all her Willpower points, she instantly phases back into the material world and the Attainment\u2019s effects end; it cannot be reused until she regains at least one Willpower point. </div><div>Furthermore, Dreamspeakers find it easier to rise through Astral Space than other mages; add a Dreamspeaker\u2019s Mind dots to her extended action Meditation dice pool to attain Astral travel. This does not apply to instant action attempts at Astral travel involving this Attainment. </div><div>Dreamspeakers use Dreamwalking to travel to Astral regions that correspond with physical places. These realms have a sacred place in Dreamspeaker lore. Some have naturally evolved from the strong emotions surrounding a location. Others were constructed by Dreamspeakers or, in ancient days, by the Dreamborn themselves. These places serve as storehouses of secret knowledge that Dreamspeakers visit to help them solve particular problems.</div>",firstAttainmentOptArcana:"",firstAttainmentOptDescrizione:"",secondAttainmentName:"Call Upon the Dreamborn",secondAttainmentPrerequisites:"Gnosis 5, Mind 3",secondAttainmentDescription:"Dreamspeakers learn this Attainment from the Dreamborn.

Once there, she acquires the wisdom of one of the Dreamborn. Henceforth, she may activate this Attainment to add her Mind dots to a single Social or Mental Attribute, as if employing Augment the Mind (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 210) for a scene. Different Dreamborn augment different Attributes, so the Dreamspeaker must choose which Attribute (and which Dreamborn she contacts) to augment before she embarks on her Astral journey.<div>She can later choose to revisit the Dreamtime and negotiate wisdom from a different Dreamborn, allowing her to choose a different Mental or Social Attribute to augment with this Attainment.

The danger is that returning is difficult; a second roll is required to cross back over the Gauntlet.

He continues to lose an additional point of Willpower per hour per dot of Spirit  (i.e., a mage with Spirit 3 would lose an additional point every four hours), so long as he remains there, although he can reactivate this Attainment to allow him to try and traverse the Gauntlet again.

That may be the case for some, but if it affects the Tamers of the Cave that way, it\u2019s hard to tell. Everything they do seems to be infused with a kind of infectious optimism. They bring hope and healing to the Sleepers around them.</div><div>It stands to reason. Unlike the other Elemental Masteries, whose chosen elemental forces are tangible and easily observable, the Tamers of the Cave master the void, the element of ether that scientists in previous centuries tried and failed to isolate.</div><div>If elemental ether was never found by Sleeper scientists, it\u2019s precisely because ether doesn\u2019t exist, by definition. Ether is the material of nothing, a non-substance that permeates and holds together the vast, empty void. Ether is the prime ingredient of ephemera, the not-living, nonexistent matter from which spirits and ghosts take their substance.</div><div>Similar to the other Elemental Masteries, the Tamers of the Cave become, in a way, their element. And they become a personification of the element\u2019s manifestation. To harness ether, then, to \u201ctame the Cave\u201d is to make something out of nothing. Using the principle of like attracting like, the Tamer of the Cave draws void from void, creating a conduit between his body and the great nothingness outside space. He brings forth from his mouth an etheric mirror, a shining, starry, semi-liquid substance made of raw void. In his hands, it\u2019s a malleable, versatile tool, and it forms the foundation of his magic, because, in effect he is the void. He is nothing and everything, all at once.</div><div>Manipulating \u2014 becoming \u2014 the material of spirits and ghosts gives the Tamers of the Cave a keen understanding of the life beyond. They might not necessarily know what\u2019s to come just yet, but armed with their knowledge of the void, they have a confidence that whatever comes after life, they can make something of it. The Tamers of the Cave have seen how everything comes from nothing, how there is a material existence permeated and held together by the substance of nothingness. They are the void. What have they to fear?</div><div>The void is also, in the thinking of the Tamers, contradiction. The void is hope and despair, faith and disbelief, all at once. They become these things personified. They become contradiction. To \u201ctame the Cave\u201d is make contradiction their reason for being. They challenge the social order in which they live. \u201cThe Cave\u201d can be seen as picture of the darkness in which so many people live, particularly the Sleepers. To tame that notional intellectual spiritual darkness is to challenge it, to show people to the exit of the cave. Some tamers do it quietly, encouraging people to question themselves and the social order in which they find themselves over long and eventful lives. Other Tamers stand tall and become activists, making themselves nuisances, burning bright and paying the ultimate price that prophets and visionaries have done for thousands of years. They\u2019re not afraid of dying.</div><div>To the Tamers of the Cave, Death is not to be feared. It\u2019s a doorway, they say, through which we must all pass. Perhaps it means a transmigration of the soul. Perhaps it\u2019s just the simple continuation of matter and energy, dissipated into the rest of the universe. Perhaps Death really does means an afterlife in some kind of perfect Heaven.</div><div>Many believe in some sort of God, or at the very least in some kind of theory that life endures in some way beyond death. To many Tamers of the Cave, the lack of evidence for any kind of transcendent intelligence is all the more reason for faith. Faith for them thrives in the absence of evidence; their magic proves that nothingness produces and creates. Is it so implausible that a creator may be found in the emptiness?</div><div>They consider their lives cheap compared to the lives of others, even Sleepers. These Tamers share the Elemental Masteries\u2019 philosophy \u2014 that their magic is there to benefit Sleeping humanity. As ones for whom death is not a thing to fear, the Tamers of the Cave are often not afraid to die for others, no matter how undeserving these others might be. There are stories of Tamers of the Cave whose sacrificial deaths were the magical tools to raise others from the dead, or even to bring about a single Awakening. There are stories of others who cheated death and rose again, before Ascending to higher states of being. They\u2019re just stories, of course, but the stories persist. </div><div>They\u2019re not all that helpful, these stories. These self-styled \u201cSaints\u201d have a reputation for throwing their lives away. It\u2019s not undeserved. The problem with a Saint is that it takes a certain kind of person to fill that role, and 99 times out of 100, that person isn\u2019t going to be the kind of person the average individual wants to sit down and have a drink with. As Tamers of the Cave grow in power and knowledge, they sometimes develop odd personality tics and messiah complexes. A Tamer of the Cave becomes intense and driven. Many begin to gain delusions about what they are and what they\u2019re capable of. They become overconfident, unable to see that perhaps they are not quite the perfect Saints they should be. Possessed of a death wish, too many Tamers of the Cave sell their lives far too cheaply, achieving nothing, violating at the last the ethos of their Legacy. They die just for the sake of dying, fooling themselves that the miracles they seek to promote are going to happen anyway without any other action. </div><div>Tamers of the Cave are rare compared to the other Elemental Masteries, so rare that many mages outside of the Elemental Masteries don\u2019t even believe these Tamers still exist. They have always been few in number, but during the last couple of hundred years, their numbers have fallen further and their few practitioners have become less and less like the men and women who won the Saints their sobriquet.</div><div>The Tamers of the Cave have traditionally recruited among people of faith. The twilight of traditional faith and the rise of fundamentalism, with its demands for simple, black-and-white truths and its inability to comprehend paradox, have a lot to do with this. People have always been willing to die for their faith, but the noble scapegoat of times past has given way to the suicide bomber and the creationist. Some people fear that a new dark age of ignorance, bigotry and violence coming upon us. Too many of the Tamers of the Cave who work their magic today seem to be the vanguard of the fundamentalists, rather than those who should, by rights, be holding it back. A large proportion of a small Legacy seem to be too keen to sacrifice themselves without purpose and without finding others to take their place. The Tamers of the Cave are dying out. Maybe it\u2019s simply because their time has gone. Maybe the world has passed them by, and there is no real place for sacrifice in this world any more. Maybe there\u2019s no place for hope.</div><div>The Tamers of the Cave who yet endure still cling to their ideals. They still have a place, they say. They still have work to do. This is their hope. For many, hope is all they have.</div>",alternateNickname:"Saints.

The kind of religious misfits whom the Legacy attracts are often the ones who could never have fully bought into the orders, with their secret formulae and tortuous conspiracies. Still, members of the orders do join the Legacy. Members of the Adamantine Arrow, while no strangers to death, have always found it hard to get their heads around suffering and dying for another rather than fighting. Still, there are Arrows who have joined the Tamers of the Cave, particularly during the 21st century. Many of these Arrows are those whose idea of sacrifice involves strapping explosives to themselves and slaughtering innocents.<div>Many mages who belong to the Mysterium find the idea of learning the secrets of the void immensely attractive. The Tamers of the Cave delve into the ultimate mystery, the fate of souls in the hereafter. It takes a selfish and reckless mage to want to find out the final secret to the extent that it doesn\u2019t matter if he doesn\u2019t come back to tell anyone else. There are many selfish and reckless mages.</div><div>The Guardians of the Veil have always held the Tamers of the Cave in suspicion. Guardians rarely become Saints, although, as is the case with the Arrows, a few have joined since the turn of the millennium. The Silver Ladder, on the other hand, has utopian ideals, even if the order doesn\u2019t live up to them, and the Tamers of the Cave find that many of the best and brightest of their Legacy have come from the Ladder.</div><div>The arrival of the Free Council changed many things. Its permissive, open nature meant that here was an order in which the misfits who would join the Tamers of the Cave could feel comfortable. Most of the Saints who come from an order nowadays come from the Free Council.</div>",appearance:"It\u2019s impossible to categorize the Tamers of the Cave. They appear, for all the world, as if they\u2019re ordinary. They look just like anyone else at first glance, with their ordinary street clothes, their ordinary haircuts and their ordinary shoes. It\u2019s only when you speak to them that you see something of the Cave in them. There\u2019s a certain eloquence all of them have, a certain disturbing quality in their eyes and voices. They are attractive and frightening, compelling and infuriating.<div>The Elemental Mark they bear on their nimbus is just as strange.

Whatever they believe in, the Tamers of the Cave are, at least to begin with, psychologically robust individuals. They have to be the kind of people who can stare into the howling void and not just laugh, but to reach into it and to make something out of it. They have to be \u2014 or have to appear to be \u2014 the kind of people who can make something wonderful out of nothing at all. They\u2019re the kind of people who become nothing and everything all at once, and laugh at the prospect. Or they should be. A very few let the nothingness take over, becoming unable to apprehend and work with the paradox of existence.

Tutors usually don\u2019t go out of their way to look for pupils. If a Tamer of the Cave sees a mage on the Path of Scourging whose disposition might make a worthwhile Saint, he approaches her, explains who he is and explains to her that he\u2019d like to take her on as a pupil. He\u2019s pretty open about it. He reasons that he has nothing to hide and if his potential pupil thinks that it\u2019s the right thing to do, notwithstanding the suffering to follow, she\u2019s probably going to work out.<div>It\u2019s more rare for a student to go seeking out a Tamer of the Cave so that he can be taught the ways of the Legacy, but it still happens sometimes.</div><div>Technically, a Tamer of the Cave is supposed to offer succor to practitioners of the other Elemental Masteries, should one of them approach her for aid.

The Tamers of the Cave cultivated the role of the outsider, the prophet. Although unfashionable now, it\u2019s a legitimate role. Plato\u2019s tutor and friend Socrates saw himself as a gadfly, a constant source of irritation to a complacent, monolithic society. He showed a new way of constant inquiry, constant self-examination.

It doesn\u2019t change the fact that society\u2019s irritants, even though any healthy society should have them \u2014 needs to have them \u2014 suffer a terrible fate. Socrates and Jesus were killed by the establishments they challenged. That was their purpose and their destiny: to challenge and question, and to die. The Tamers of the Cave have fallen into that role for millennia, and for millennia, they\u2019ve paid the price for it.</div><div>Thanks to the Quiescence, their role has shrunk. The Tamers of the Cave cannot be the open miracle-workers they once were, and they cannot take the role of leaders in mass movements. So, over the centuries, they\u2019ve worked on a much smaller scale, either taking small parts in mass movements, or working to challenge individual lives, Sleeping and Awakened, one life at a time.</div><div>A Tamer of the Cave stood and died with the Diggers. The Radical Dissenters had a Tamer of the Cave among their number. There was a Tamer of the Cave in India following Gandhi, and a Tamer of the Cave in the civil rights struggle.

There\u2019s an exit, but no one can see it, because everyone is chained down in such a way that he can only see the back of the cave. Now shadows of various objects and ideas are projected against the back of the cave by unseen jailers. Because the people trapped in the cave don\u2019t know any better, they think these shadows are in fact the real thing. Someone\u2019s chains loosen. Maybe they break, maybe he figures out a way to escape. Blinking, he turns around and sees the sunlight. He covers his eyes and steps out of the cave into the outside world for the first time.</div><div>Gradually, he realizes that the cave wasn\u2019t even a fraction of the world \u2014 his jailers tricked him. He returns to the cave, and tries to tell the people in there what he\u2019s seen. He tries to get them out. Some of them don\u2019t believe him. Some of them think he\u2019s causing trouble. Maybe a few believe him and try to escape. Some even make it out and see the real world for themselves. But most stay in their chains, thinking that the cave is all there is.</div><div>Plato records Socrates as reckoning that this was what the world was like. The one who takes up philosophy and begins on the path of wisdom is like the one who gets out of the cave. The Tamers of the Cave teach the same allegory, but they interpret it in a different light. To them, the cave with all the people chained up in it and forced to take a limited, shadow reality, that\u2019s still the world. But the unseen jailers are the Exarchs, whose will enforces the Quiescence, and the man who escapes his chains is one who Awakens to magic.</div><div>The reason the allegory us important to the Tamers of the Cave is because of the implications. They have to go back into the Cave, having seen the vastness of the Outside, because they need to try to free the Sleepers. Not all of them are going to listen, and of those who begin to question the world they live in, few will break their chains. But some, some are going to hear the word and break their chains. Some are going to Awaken. It\u2019s the ultimate contradiction. It\u2019s the ultimate expression of something inside every Sleeper that comes from nothing.</div><div>There\u2019s a dream that one of the Tamers of the Cave had, more than 2,000 years ago, that perhaps they could do it, perhaps they could Awaken the entire human race. It\u2019s failed. Never many, the Tamers of the Cave are dwindling away to nothing now, and their grand enterprise seems to have got them nowhere. Even so, that\u2019s no reason to stop. Every human soul freed and Awakened is another spark of the Supernal, shining into the Fallen World. </div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Art of Dying</h3><div>Over the centuries, Tamers of the Cave have given their lives for the people they meet. Some of the Tamers of the Cave have made their entire lives into passion plays. They live in order to die. The Tamer of the Cave\u2019s death can becomes a powerful sacrificial means of effecting change. Tamers of the Cave don\u2019t set out to die, at least not to begin with. But it\u2019s their role, their place as prophet and outsider, to suffer, and many do, just by taking on the role. However, a Tamer who embarks upon the Calvary road soon realizes that she is going to die.</div><div>She surrounds herself with friends, perhaps even taking on some pupils. And then she contrives to place herself in a narrative \u2014 a passion play \u2014 of her own death. Her friends might not realize that it\u2019s happening, but she\u2019ll contrive it so that they fall into roles, too \u2014 Beloved Disciple, Right Hand, Loyal Doubter, Loose Cannon and, of course, Traitor. Enemies are easier to find. Guardians of the Veil, who would kill for their tradition. Seers of the Throne, whose entire ethos depends upon enforcing the Quiescence. Vampires, who would kill without the interference of some crusading miracle-worker. Sleeper authorities, legitimate and criminal, who see a charismatic activist as a threat.</div><div>If the Tamer of the Cave does everything right, she\u2019s going to suffer and die. In this world, there are plenty of opportunities to die. A real-life passion play is remarkably easy to set up, and the play can really be the thing, even to the extent that the setting up of the play can overtake the whole point of dying in the first place. It\u2019s true that some mages join the Legacy because of a death wish. They might not even know they have it. A mage might fool herself that she\u2019s got a cause to give herself to. In fact, she\u2019s just caught up with the glamour of dying young, of being halfway between St. Sebastian and Kurt Cobain.</div><div>The Saints\u2019 Attainments give them an intimate glimpse into the hazy state of existence called Twilight, where ghosts haunt the living and cling to anchors. Many mages, witnessing this place of lost shades, conclude that death is something to be avoided or controlled. Not so the Saints. They see past this image of trapped souls to something deeper. The ancient Tamers of the Cave did not believe, as the Atlanteans taught, that ghosts were empty shells of the living, capable of being manipulated like matter. The Tamers of the Cave taught that ghosts were shadows cast by departed souls \u2014 shadows that still had strong sympathetic ties to those souls. By freeing ghosts, the Saints freed souls.</div><div>This didn\u2019t mean they went around dissolving anchors \u2014 some souls needed the confinement that their ghostly shadows\u2019 suffered, so that the challenge of their continued existence could lead them to greater freedom once their ghosts resolved the issues that anchored them to the world. The Saints seek to challenge the dead as the Saint do the living, and free the dead only if they rise to the challenge. A few Tamers of the Cave have chosen to minister to the dead rather than the living, dying in sacrifice for those who have already passed that veil.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Atonement and Triumph</h3><div>The real question is, what\u2019s the point? What does dying achieve that living and fighting can\u2019t? Why should someone die? The answer is not a simple one, but it boils down to this: it\u2019s magic. Magic doesn\u2019t follow the rules of the Sleeping World. Magic doesn\u2019t bow to any human logic. Sometimes the cause of magic needs a sacrifice.</div><div>In a chronicle of magic and enlightenment, a perverse act such as putting oneself in the path of death at the point of climax could change everything. A sacrifice like this can bring redemption. It can bring freedom. It can also be a crock, a pointless waste that achieves nothing except the consummation of a mage\u2019s death-urge. The journey toward a sacrificial death, then, is not to be embarked upon lightly. It\u2019s not a suicide, because the intention is to achieve something by it, and because there\u2019s always the tiny hope, even if it\u2019s unfounded, that death might not have to be the result of following this path.</div><div>And the achievement? The story goes that when a Tamer of the Cave dies, someone Awakens. Maybe the void, as an elemental force tied to the Fallen World, gives up the mage\u2019s Awakened soul, bonding it with someone else. In the stories, that person is someone who knew the mage. It doesn\u2019t have to be, of course. It could be a complete stranger, no more than someone who made eye contact moments before the mage died. Saints who study the ethos of sacrifice and redemption often find useful the different models of atonement that Christian theologians present.</div><div><b>Victory:</b> By choosing death, the Tamer of the Cave conquers it; it holds no fear for him, and no fear for any other. He suffers and dies to save lives, many lives. His death might result, but in dying, he gives his friends the time to escape, time to win through. In his final moments, his killers realize that they have not won, and that through killing him, they have defeated themselves, and that they have the consequences of his murder to deal with.</div><div><b>Penal Substitution:</b> The Tamer of the Cave contrives it so that he, innocent, dies in the place of someone who deserves to die. For example, the Saint switches places with an inmate on Death Row, moments before his execution. The sentence having been passed, the person whose life was saved owes it to the Saint to make something of his life. The formerly condemned man doesn\u2019t have to acknowledge the debt. The choice is his. It\u2019s up to him what he does with it.</div><div><b>The Ransom:</b> The Saint gives up her life so that others, who are imprisoned and innocent, can go free. Perhaps their imprisonment is literal \u2014 they might be in an internment camp, for example. Or maybe it\u2019s figurative. Perhaps, when the Tamer dies on their behalf, enlightenment results. Their chains fall off, and they lift their heads and see the way of out of the cave for the first time. Perhaps it even means that they Awaken, en masse.</div><div><b>Solidarity:</b> The Tamer of the Cave pours out her life for the downtrodden, the poor, the diseased, the suffering. Perhaps AIDS victims. Perhaps the homeless and disenfranchised. Perhaps 100 slave-labor sweatshop workers in the Philippines. By dying for them, she shows that she is prepared to share in their suffering, even their deaths, in order to support and protect them. She provides an example, and through her death enfranchises and inspires many of those whom the rest of society has discounted. The rest is up to them.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Death Is Not the End</h3><div>Is that the end? Perhaps not. Rumors persist of Tamers of the Cave who return, briefly, to life after having died, to teach their friends and work more miracles, before finally vanishing forever.</div><div>There are a few who swear blindly, even today, that their tutor, who died, rose again \u2014 literally, bodily rose again. He gave words of encouragement, words of warning, and then vanished from their sight. Could it be that a Tamer of the Cave can transcend death? And if so, what could one who has died and rose again achieve? And where would he go when his work was done? Some say that Tamers of the Cave often become ghost mages (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 327), although others claim that Saints never do. </div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>False Prophets</h3><div>Prophets aren\u2019t always right, and they\u2019re not always spotless. Christ wasn\u2019t the only prophet of change of his day, and he wasn\u2019t the only miracle-worker. There were others, some who led their followers to their deaths, or who abandoned the faithful when they most needed their prophets.</div><div>A prophet often finds followers and the affirmation of those followers can make a person with mystical powers, especially one so prone to Hubris, arrogant. The people who hang on a prophet\u2019s words place him on a pedestal, and that pedestal can be narrow, tall and unstable. The followers of a false prophet (or even a true prophet) can turn on their former master and end him. There\u2019s that old, bleak joke about the church congregation who stoned their preacher to death, arguing that the Bible said that you should stone a false prophet, and that since it said nothing about not stoning a real prophet, it was better to be on the safe side.</div><div>Even if they don\u2019t turn on him, the prophet can find himself using the faithful. There are news stories every year about leaders of religious groups who take the faithful for every penny they have, use members of their congregation as sex objects or who inspire them to do darker, more violent things.</div><div>And then there\u2019s dying. A prophet doesn\u2019t have to die, but many do. Not all of them die for any reason more than they\u2019ve got a death wish. A prophet with a powerful personality can easily bring his followers to die with him, possibly through mass suicide (for example, the Heaven\u2019s Gate cult or the inhabitants of Jonestown) or acts of suicidal violence in aid of the \u201ccause.\u201d The number of Tamers of the Cave is small. Fewer still act this way. Few fall. But as time goes on, the number of those who abuse their flocks, who fall prey to nihilism, who die for no reason, is growing steadily. </div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction </h2><div>The Tamers of the Cave have never been the most attractive of Legacies. Prophets, especially potential martyrs, don\u2019t appear spontaneously. Experienced Tamers are always looking for pupils. Those who approach a Tamer of the Cave and ask to join the Legacy are often given a fair chance, although the tutor should try to ascertain whether the potential pupil is cut out for the role or not.</div><div>The problem often lies in the simple fact that it\u2019s difficult to tell a real passionate outsider from someone who simply has a death wish, either consciously or unconsciously. Some Tamers of the Cave accept as pupils people who need therapy, not teaching.</div><div>Assuming, after a pupil has been told what initiation entails, that the pupil still wants to go through with it, the prospective Tamer of the Cave retreats to a lonely place and fasts and, under the guidance and supervision of the tutor, meditates on 99 traditional paradoxical phrases, learning them by heart with the tutor\u2019s help and repeating them over and over. This could take a few days. It could take weeks. It goes on until the pupil dies.</div><div>He doesn\u2019t really die. The hunger, thirst and constant meditation send the pupil into an altered state of consciousness, where he experiences death. For three days, he knows exactly what it means to be dead, and in those three days, when he experiences the joy of resurrection, he is transformed. He understands that he has become hope and despair, everything and nothing, creation and void.</div><div>The tutor is there all the time and \u2014 perhaps because of the connection brought about by the exertion of his will \u2014 knows when her pupil is likely to come back to life. When the pupil returns, crying, taking in great gulps of air as if he never figured out to breathe before, the tutor is there, with a simple meal and some water. The vegetables, bread and water taste better than anything the pupil has ever eaten.</div><div>Tutor and pupil work closely together, over the next few weeks. The tutor helps the pupil create the etheric mirror for the first time, and trains him in sculpting it and using it. Each further Attainment involves a long period of fasting and meditation, although not to the point of death, apparent or otherwise. Each time, the tutor is there to help the pupil work with his new ability.</div>",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"<div>The central principle behind the magic of the Saints is the \u201cetheric mirror,\u201d a malleable substance created from the void itself. It\u2019s similar but not identical to ephemera, the stuff of spirits and ghosts.The Tamer of the Cave has become the void, and thus, he can draw more of the void through himself. He spits it out and works it with his hands into a form that he can use to create his magic, in much the same way as a mage using the Death Arcanum might work with ectoplasm. The etheric mirror isn\u2019t so much black as it is the color of the void. It appears to be a window, through which one can see infinite space, stars and all. Sometimes it takes on a reflective mirror-sheen (the legendary \u201cmagic mirror\u201d of shamans). Sometimes it becomes white and opaque. Whatever it\u2019s used for, when the Tamer of the Cave has finished using it, it vanishes in about a minute.</div><div>Practically every spell cast by a Tamer of the Cave could be cast using this substance in some way, and he can use it as a dedicated casting tool. He doesn\u2019t have to, but many Saints do. A Saint casting a healing spell, for example, spits out a handful of the etheric mirror, which he spreads over the injury he wants to heal. As the spell does its work, the void stuff fades away. If he wants to create a scrying window, he does much the same thing, spitting the etheric mirror onto a wall or table, and using his hands to spread it out into a real mirror, which clears and becomes the window through which he can see through to other places and dissolves into the air when the spell is done.</div><div>All of the Saints\u2019 Attainments depend upon the Etheric Communion \u2014 a Tamer of the Cave has to produce the etheric mirror (using the first Attainment) before he can then use it to create the effects of the second and third Attainments. </div>",firstAttainmentName:"Etheric Communion",firstAttainmentPrerequisites:"Gnosis 3, Death 2 (primary), Mind 1, Occult 3",firstAttainmentDescription:"<div>The very first Attainment of the Void, the first thing new Tamers of the Cave learn, is the ability to create the etheric mirror.</div><div>The mage uses her own body as a conduit between the void and the Material Realm, spitting out (as an instant action) the strange, malleable material.

The etheric mirror remains for one scene, or until the spell the mage is using it for is done, whichever comes first, at which point it dissipates back into nothingness.

As she rubs it into her hands, the etheric mirror spreads over her body, clothes and anything she is carrying. Within a turn, she becomes a walking, thinking etheric mirror, able to shift into and out of Twilight at will. Changing requires an instant action, and the player rolls Stamina + Occult + Death to make the shift. Regaining her corporeal substance takes another instant action, but requires no roll.

Drawing a connection with the deepest fears and guiltiest secrets of her target, she makes her target see things that either have come to pass, things that might come to pass (but might not) and things that don\u2019t have any real existence outside of the target\u2019s mind.</div><div>The idea is often to make the target change his ways, or to express a prophetic idea that can\u2019t be expressed through words alone. </div><div>What the target sees isn\u2019t completely up to the Saint. The mage doesn\u2019t get to see what the target sees, although the Saint does get to define what she wants the result of the target\u2019s vision could be. A politician might see the terrible, violent consequences that could result from his current course of action (the intention being that he change his policies). A hard-bitten killer might see his long-dead mother expressing shame at what he\u2019s become (the object is that he repents). A bigoted preacher could imagine himself caught in the flames of Hell. On the other hand, a man about to commit suicide might see a vision of a guardian angel or of some other friendly, comforting figure, telling him that he doesn\u2019t need to go through with it.</div><div>The effect of this Attainment is similar to the Mind 4 \u201cHallucination\u201d spell.

When the vision has begun, the target can deny its reality at any time, with a roll of Resolve + Composure. If the target believes the vision, there\u2019s still no guarantee that he will change his ways.

The people need their inspirational leaders. Ever since the very beginnings of civilization, there have been the warriors and the statesmen, the men and women of honor and bright inspiration. The Taming of wild, dangerous Fire is one of the very first things that humans did, arguably the point at which they became fully human, as they took on the power and responsibility of the flame.</div><div>The Tamers of Fire harness that primal energy. In their hearts, the Fire has the same power, the same wild abandon, the same need for responsibility and restraint. Fire, for these Champions, is the element of will, unstoppable and implacable, against which the only sane response is to stand down. Fire is the element of intuition, of innovation, the fire that triggered the beginnings of human civilization. Fire is the element of leadership, the pillar of fire in the wilderness that leads the invading hordes into the Promised Land, to buy it with blood and steel. Fire is the element of trial, the burning, cleansing flame that refines and purifies in pain and heat, incinerating the dross and leaving the gold. </div><div>Fire is also the element of anger, of rage uncontrolled, that burns and destroys. Fire is the element of madness. Fire is the element of destruction. Fire is transient and temporary. One day, it is impossible to fight against; the next, it has burnt itself out. In Taming the Fire, the Champions embody all of these aspects. In the process of soulcrafting, they grow to understand their element, to mold it and make it their tool. They become the fire, and through becoming the fire, take on the role of the hero. Their magic concentrates on the fire in every respect: on the uncanny manipulation of the physical flame, and in the inner fire of inspiration and courage. </div><div>The hero was a superhuman figure. He stood in the space between humans and god. The Tamers of Fire stand in that place. Through the act of soulcrafting, they become the fire. The Tamers believed that Fire was inspiration and rage and destruction and courage, that the abstract concept and the elemental force were the same thing. The mage is also these things \u2014 he just doesn\u2019t know it yet. By taking the fire within himself, he becomes the fire. He becomes inspiration. His is the \u201chand that dare seize the fire,\u201d because he is the fire.</div><div>In this age of Quiescence, others might think that the Tamers of Fire need to limit their exploits. They\u2019re still heroes, but their magic needs to be smaller, the scope of their heroism smaller. But the fire that they have become won\u2019t allow itself to be quenched. They defy the Quiescence. The fire rages against all limits. The fire will not be stopped until it is doused altogether. The Quiescence has the power to do that to the Champions\u2019 magic, certainly, but fire will not back down. It can\u2019t be reasoned with. It can\u2019t be made to change its mind.</div><div>Except that the Tamers know that it can. The fire is in everyone. They just don\u2019t know it. A passionate speaker can sway the fire within a man\u2019s heart. The same rhetorical techniques can, in the employ of a Tamer of Fire, sway the very fires themselves. Some of these Champions aim for inspiration through excellence. Some excel in the field of sports. Others inspire through words, becoming crusading activists, defenders of rights, leaders in their field. Others still become heroes in their work: there are firefighters, police officers, paramedics and soldiers among the Tamers. The days when a man or woman could transform the entire world and be remembered for millennia are long gone. But sometimes small triumphs are enough. It\u2019s the way of the hero to blaze brightly and burn out. If the hero burns more dimly and flickers to nothing that much faster, what of it? In this world, any fire at all is enough.</div>",alternateNickname:"Champions",orders:" Given the martial nature of so many of the Tamers of Fire, it\u2019s no surprise that so many of them come from the Adamantine Arrow. Although the Silver Ladder\u2019s more hardline members are wary of the way the Champions value ties with the Sleepers, the Ladder has a need for heroes in these dark days, and many Ladders see the superhuman potential of the Champions as a means to find a new kind of future. The Mysterium has its scholars, but there are always those who would raid ancient ruins and interpret ancient lore in new, brightly intuitive ways. They, too, look to join the Tamers of Fire. Although the Free Council has, perhaps, less time for heroes stepping out of myth, this order has its own great men, and the Libertines find Champions whose fire is directed toward reform and the advancement of human rights attractive.<div>The Tamers of Fire draw very few of their recruits from the Guardians of the Veil. The Guardians have long thought the Tamers of Fire to be careless braggarts, who waste their magic  on the Sleepers and court Paradoxes. Most of the Tamers of Fire, meanwhile, have little time for the paranoia and strict control that the Guardians seem to hold so dear.</div>",appearance:" The Tamers of Fire can come from any walk of life. Many are good-looking and in fine physical shape. Although the skin on their arms and chests is sometimes marred after a while with small burns, most of the Tamers of Fire know how to avoid harm from flames, and a Champion with serious burn scars is rate. Eloquence is a must. Tamers of Fire often work their magic by convincing the flames to obey them. A person needs to be pretty convincing to do that.<div>A Champion\u2019s nimbus alters as he takes on the first Attainment of the Legacy, and develops a fiery, powerful quality. Blazing angels sing. Flames appear to burst from the mage\u2019s skin. Lightning flashes around the mage. Even when not visible, the Elemental Mark has its effect. The Tamers of Fire could be the epitome of the figure with burning eyes, the bright, bold, charismatic hero.</div>",background:"Anyone can be a hero. In myth, the hero is just as often a lowly shepherd as he is the son of a king, a Maid of Orleans as often as the daughter of the King of France. The hero, and hence the Champion, is defined in spite of his or her origin, not because of it. The Tamers of Fire don\u2019t go looking for their pupils. Their pupils make themselves known to the Tamers. They look for Theurgists who distinguish themselves as leaders, as people of courage, and not just physical courage.  They value intellectual courage and spiritual courage just as much, and value most of all an individual with the courage of his or her convictions.<div>More Tamers of Fire are male than female. There is an unfortunate vein of sexism running through the Legacy\u2019s history, and women who join the Champions often have to prove themselves to be better than the men in order to be accepted as equals. Even the most radical Tamers of Fire are somewhat patriarchal in their radicalism.</div><div>Governments come and governments fall, but in the eyes of the Tamers of Fire, there will always be governments of some kind. The Tamers of Fire might sometimes be revolutionaries, but they are rarely anarchists. The hero is a part of the social order, and needs a social order to be part of. His relationship with his order works on the same lines. A Tamer of Fire tends not to challenge the status quo of his order. He finds other battles to fight.</div>",organizzation:" A Tamer of Fire who sees a likely pupil tests him. The test, traditionally, is part of the initiation. A tutor takes on only those pupils whom he considers to be worthy of the Legacy. A potential Tamer of Fire who approaches another to be taught has to prove himself worthy. Similar to David, who had to prove himself by slaying the Philistine giant, a possible student might have to undergo a quest or achieve some seemingly impossible feat.<div>As with the other Elemental Masteries, there\u2019s an expectation for Tamers of Fire to respect and aid other bearers of the Elemental Mark, but it\u2019s not an obligation. The only real bond among the Tamers of Fire is the bond that links tutor and pupil, and even that can be shaky. When individuals driven by such wild passions come together, fireworks all too often result.</div><div>The other Elemental Masteries respect and fear the Tamers of Fire in equal measure. The Tamers of Winds give the Tamers of Fire direction, and in return they supply passion. The Tamers of Stone, who are more grounded by definition, supply the foundation from which the Champions can base their work. Awkwardness characterizes their relationships with the Tamers of Rivers. Fire and water rarely mix, and when they do, tempers often rise to boiling point as the direct Tamers of Fire and the subtle Tamers of Rivers clash over methods. Still, both the Champions and the Travelers recognize that they need each other, even if, in practice, they differ on how best to serve their society.</div>",suggestedOblations:" Starting a campfire in the middle of nowhere by the \u201ctwo sticks\u201d method.

But then, that\u2019s part of the point. It\u2019s the idea of the hero that\u2019s important, not whether what he did is historically accurate.

The Fire brings liberty, but the Fire also brings extremism. It sweeps across the field, bringing change, but rages out of control. The Revolutions in Russia and France were both borne on a fire of inspiration that rapidly got out of control. The torch of liberty became its funeral pyre, as reigns of terror in both nations burnt away the good as well as the bad. The First World War began as a great patriotic venture in dozens of countries, and wiped out a whole generation of young men. What good were the ideals of the hero when 100,000 men could die in an afternoon, lost forever in an agony of gas, blood and sucking mire? </div><div>Even now, the Champion can go too far. Perhaps a Tamer of Fire blindly follows a flawed leader or a discredited philosophy. Perhaps the Champion falls prey to the easy certainties of violent fundamentalism.

Like the Fire that is bonded with them in essence, they have the potential to cause vast destruction. </div><div>The Tamers of Fire are the best known of the Elemental Masteries among the Awakened.

The superhuman paragon beloved of the Hollywood action movie is no hero. The true hero is human, and just as any other human being, he has limitations. A hero becomes a hero by transcending these limitations. A true superhuman can only become so by recognizing his flawed humanity and refining it in the furnace. </div><div>There are several ways a hero can be flawed. Tamers of Fire don\u2019t go out of their way to pick flawed pupils, but the kind of people who bear the mark of heroism are often the kind of people who have needed to defeat their limitations. </div><div><b>Physical Flaws:</b> Some of the great heroic figures of history and myth had physical drawbacks that they overcame or addictions they fought their entire lives. Horatio Nelson and Quintus Sertorius were one-eyed. Nelson had only one arm. Julius Caesar was epileptic. Oedipus was abandoned as a child with a metal spike through his foot, and walked for the rest of his life with a limp. </div><div><b>Mental Flaws:</b> Psychological weaknesses can also prove disastrous for the hero. Herakles went mad; Achilles was prone to irrational rages. Alexander was an alcoholic and a megalomaniac. Oedipus\u2019 inability to know when to stop asking questions proved his downfall. Samson\u2019s weakness for a pretty face cost him dearly. </div><div><b>Social Flaws:</b> Some heroes have terrible secrets, or have made enemies from terrible mistakes they made in their pasts. Oedipus was destroyed by a terrible secret that even he didn\u2019t know. Arthur\u2019s plot to destroy the incest-born son who was prophesied to kill him not only failed, but turned the boy against him and sealed his fate. </div><div><b>Mystical Flaws:</b> A very few heroes suffer from flaws with a magical or divine origin. C\xfa Chulaind was doomed to die if he ate a dog, but was under an injunction never to refuse hospitality if offered \u2014 when a woman invited him into her home and gave him a stew made from dogmeat, he had no choice but to accept it and die. Samson\u2019s supernatural strength depended on the length of his hair.</div><div> <h4 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Flaws and Characters</h3> <div>Many of the imperfect heroes of myth had several imperfections. A Tamer of Fire character probably has at least one Flaw (see the World of Darkness Rulebook, p. 217) \u2014 if she doesn\u2019t, there\u2019s always the chance she\u2019ll develop one or more as she develops the Attainments of the Flame. The heroes of legend didn\u2019t always begin their lives with their Flaws, and there\u2019s no reason a Tamer of Fire character shouldn\u2019t gain a Flaw as time goes on. </div><div>Notionally, the more Flaws a Champion has, the more \u201cmythic\u201d in stature she can be. Powerful Tamers of Fire could have many Flaws. Players\u2019 characters, on the other hand, aren\u2019t usually powerful to begin with, let alone mythic. Not yet, anyway. With a more average starting character, one Flaw can provide plenty of interesting plot complications. The point of Flaws, particularly with the Tamers of Fire, is to provide a limitation that a character has to conquer. Too many could make a character unplayable.</div> <h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Once a Tamer of the Fire has chosen the one he wants to teach, the Champion puts his prospective pupil through a hero\u2019s ordeal. The pupil might not even realize it \u2014 the initiation takes the form of a journey in the real world, with real dangers, a quest partly contrived by the tutor. </div><div>First comes the Call. The tutor asks the mage to go on the quest, without telling her why. Here, the prospective pupil may not wish to begin the quest. This Refusal is usual \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s to be expected; some tutors treat as failures those who go on the quest without some initial hesitation, reasoning that a hero may be brave, but should not, ideally, be foolhardy. </div><div>If the pupil has refused to answer the call once, the tutor appears and explains something more of the quest, and why it is important. Perhaps he appeals to the pupil on moral grounds. Perhaps he appeals on the grounds of self-knowledge. Either way, he produces a spiritual carrot on a stick, leading the pupil to the next stage, a First Trial. The enemy may be real. The quest may be truly dangerous. It may involve the pupil\u2019s friends, and there is no shame in that. A series of tests follow: a test of skill, a test of knowledge, a test of integrity, a physical test, leading to a place of darkness, a Cave , where the pupil faces a life-threatening ordeal. If the hero-in-training gets out alive, she needs to escape. It\u2019s here that the tutor reveals all. If the pupil is willing to continue, she is granted a vision of the Flame, burning away the imperfections in her soul. It\u2019s now she is a full member of the Legacy. </div><div>Each subsequent Attainment works in the same way \u2014 a real quest, a real journey, which ends with a vision of the Flame. Each time the tutor is there at beginning and end to send the pupil on her way and to show her the refining Fire and guide her to the next Attainment.</div>",magic:"<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Magic</h2> The Tamers of Fire master fire in all of its forms. Their magic controls the flame in its physical and symbolic manifestations. It can be a terrible, glorious thing to see a Champion, blazing brightly, with a band of friends who\u2019d die for each other at his side and an army of living flames springing from his hand. They\u2019re also adept in the magic of the mind. To the Tamers of Fire, it\u2019s the same thing. When they work with fire, they talk to it, convince it to do their bidding. The mind and the fire are one and the same, and if the heart of a man can be swayed by impassioned talk, so can the fire itself.",attainmentsDescrizione:"Each of the Champions\u2019 Attainments depends upon fire. However, since the Tamers of Fire consider heroic abstracts such as inspiration, courage and rage to be the same thing, the fire can be symbolic as well as literal. Attainment effects that alter physical flames (using Forces synergy) require the Tamer  of Flame to have a small flame of his own that he can use as a focus to affect the flames. Many Tamers of Fire smoke. Most keep a box of matches or a lighter on their persons.<div>Attainments that use the symbolic flame need a different kind of fire, the fire of flashing eyes and passionate talk.

As an instant action, he can cause his body to give off intense amounts of heat, enough to ignite nearby flammable objects. The Champion\u2019s player rolls Presence + Intimidation; the successes determine the intensity of the flame and the damage it inflicts (one lethal point per success), similar to Potency points in the \u201cFirestarter\u201d spell (see above). Unlike that spell, the effects of Become the  Fire are confined to a one-yard radius around the mage. The mage is immune to this heat, and anything he wears or carries will not ignite. Anyone trying to attack the Tamer with melee combat suffers from the incredible heat, suffering its damage per turn of contact. In addition, anything flammable that the person is wearing or holding might catch fire. The Storyteller should keep track of the amount of heat damage inflicted per turn; if the cumulative amount exceeds a flammable object\u2019s Durability, the object ignites. The Tamer of Fire has enough control over the effect that he can exempt certain people or objects from the worst of his heat, so that they do not suffer damage or ignite. He can exempt one object in his radius (in addition to those he carries) per Gnosis dot per turn. The Tamer of Fire can cancel this Attainment with an instant action.",thirdAttainmentOptArcana:"Mind 4",thirdAttainmentOptDescrizione:"The mage can now use the fire in his heart to refine and burn away the imperfections in the hearts of the people who follow him.

The water flows, constantly, in constant flux, constant change. The waters renew themselves constantly, and gradually change the nature of their landscape. The waters have many voices for change. </div><div>The waters are the very origin of creation. They\u2019re the living fount from which all other things take their being. The symbolic river runs to the primordial ocean, which contains all life forces. The waters bring fertility. The rain that waters the parched land brings life from what once was barren and dead. </div><div>The waters excite sensation. The gentle flow of water across human skin. The rise and fall of the fluids in the body dictates the physical response to desire, the transfer of life borne in water its culmination, its purpose. </div><div>The waters purify. Catholics flock in their thousands to the holy shrine of Lourdes to experience the healing powers of its waters. Hindus visit the sacred city of Varanasi, to cleanse themselves in the restorative waters of the Ganges. </div><div>The waters erode. The waters constantly alter their surroundings. The gradual erosion of the rocks happens over millennia. And yet, the gentle, persistent movement of the waters hides frightening powers. Water can just as easily bring destruction and death, in the devastating power of a tsunami, the wild, unpredictable anger of a flash flood. The river, without warning, becomes the mysterious depths that kill and annihilate. Water is healing and fertility, but water is also the dark habitation of demonic powers, the element of \u201ctehom\u201d or Tiamat \u2014 the dragon of watery chaos. The principle of life becomes a principle of death all too easily. </div><div>To Tame the River is to become water, and to become all of these principles. The Tamers of Rivers, for as long as they have practiced their magical arts, have claimed to have held the keys to life and death and everything that lies beyond. They\u2019re all change, all transformation, and, like the path of the conceptual River that represents all rivers, it\u2019s a constant journey, from spring to river to sea to sky to ground to spring . . . and back again. </div><div>Their role in society has always to be agents of change in all things. Sometimes they join with artists and radicals. Sometimes they\u2019re activists. Sometimes they\u2019re healers and teachers. Rarely do they stick with one job or one identity. The Tamers of Rivers make the constant flow their tool. The unpredictability of this River, the symbolic representation of what they have become, makes soulcrafting fraught with pain and personal insecurities. </div><div>Every artist knows that, just as the ability to create beauty comes from somewhere outside of herself, so the source of her inspiration could just as suddenly dry up. Every inspired healer knows that, someday, his ability to heal could simply disappear, irretrievably and forever. </div><div>The River can run dry. This fear, that one day their power could be made drought, inspires many to continue creating. Many do so at a prodigious rate, feeling compelled to do as much as possible before the power to do so deserts them. Many Tamers of Rivers experience periods, which can be anything from a few days to months or years at a time, when they feel devoid of creative energy. They ebb and flow, going through phases of low and high water. When the rain of inspiration has not fallen for some time, the Tamers of Rivers can embark on periods of the blackest depression. Most come out of the other side of times like this, springing from the dry ground with renewed vigor and freshness. Some may fall into cynicism and stagnate, no longer having the will to continue developing the Attainments of the River. </div><div>Tamers of Rivers, like the River itself, don\u2019t settle in one place for very long. Historically, they were always travelers. Part of a tradition that began among some of the earliest matrilineal societies, they moved from tribe to tribe, city to city, promoting the arts of healing and childcare and teaching the benefits of culture, literacy and the arts. </div><div>These days, many of the \u201cTravelers\u201d have permanent homes, but the need to keep on the move still lingers. Many move their home at least once a year, and avoid putting down firm roots for fear of getting stuck in one place. The principle of their soulcrafting depends on them becoming water, becoming constant change, becoming embodiments of frequent movement. The idea of spending a lifetime living and working in a single city or town is all but anathema: still waters soon become stagnant waters. If they take jobs at all, they usually avoid office jobs, preferring the freedom of jobs that let them move around. Their relationships are frequently fraught with difficulties. Lovers of Tamers of Rivers often accuse them, not always unfairly, of a fear of commitment. </div><div>Similar to the other Elemental Masteries, the Tamers of Rivers value the Sleepers and choose to live among them. Having been, in a real sense, reborn, the Travelers feel compelled to share some of their newfound energies with those around them, to put things right, to restore wholeness and completeness and bring beauty into a world that is often ugly and fragmented. </div><div>Not everyone welcomes their interventions. Not everyone considers a perfect society to be an itinerant one. Many other mages dismiss the Tamers of Rivers as oddballs. This doesn\u2019t stop them from trying to help and sharing their vision with the world. Mages who have given their all to the River are not doing it for respect and praise.</div>They\u2019re doing it because they can\u2019t help it.",alternateNickname:"Thyrsus",orders:" Few Tamers of Rivers come from the Adamantine Arrow. The Tamers of Rivers are quite simply not martial, and while they\u2019re not necessarily hostile to the Arrows, the Arrows usually see the Travelers as something of an irrelevance. Likewise, members of the Guardians of the Veil have little time for the principles of constant change the Tamers of Rivers espouse, and very few consider the Travelers a fit course to take.<div>The Tamers of Rivers are, however, very at home in the Free Council. Libertines have joined the Tamers of Rivers for as long as they have existed. The Mysterium, too, has time for the Travelers\u2019 magic. The Mysterium\u2019s members often value travel \u2014 it\u2019s a great way to gather information, and a reason to join, although not the only reason. Mages in the Silver Ladder, too, has few issues with the Travelers. Although their hierarchical structure and views toward the Sleepers can be a real sticking point, the utopian (and yet often traditionalist) ideals of many of the Tamers of Rivers are attractive to the more idealistic members of the Ladder.</div>",appearance:"Tamers of Rivers often have an intuitive sense of style and harmony about them. They are good at choosing clothes that co-ordinate. They often have a natural eye for color and design. Although, superficially, they dress pretty much like everyone else, they usually add their own flourishes to their outfits. Even in a formal setting, they wear something that gives away a hint of their creative, dynamic nature, whether it be red stripes in an otherwise immaculate hairstyle or a hand-painted pendant beneath a classically cut suit.<div>They often dress provocatively, and they can be very tactile in the way they relate to others. They talk openly about things that many people find embarrassing \u2014 relationships, illnesses, personal histories.</div><div>The Elemental Mark transforms their nimbus, giving it some of the conceptual nature of water. Perhaps it makes the Traveler seem as though she\u2019s visible through deep water. Perhaps the viewer develops the uncomfortable sensation of being immersed in deep water.</div>",background:" Many Tamers of Rivers come from medical or creative backgrounds. Some may also be engaged in areas that bring people together, such as trade or diplomacy. <div>When the Tamers of Rivers first appeared, the Travelers were entirely female. In the modern, Fallen World, they\u2019re still mostly women. A few men have joined the Legacy over the last few decades, challenging the perception of many Awakened within the Elemental Masteries of the nature of their \u201cwomen\u2019s magic.\u201d Many modern Tamers of Rivers express their magic through various neo-pagan expressions of religion. For many of the Tamers of Rivers, the nature of the revitalizing power of the River lies in healing and the bringing of wholeness. That which is ugly must be transformed into something beautiful, either metaphorically or physically. Beautiful things still have room for improvement and room for change, and should become something more beautiful. A Tamer of Rivers might work to mend a broken relationship. That same Traveler might spend just as much time adding an element of conflict to a perfectly healthy relationship, keeping it (in the mage\u2019s eyes) from stagnating. </div><div>Childbirth and fertility were ancient concerns of the Tamers of Rivers. Although the business of bearing children is, in the developed West, nowhere near as difficult as it was in times past, there are many Travelers who have a particular affinity with children. The lore of the Tamers of Rivers idealized children. The Travelers speak, not always entirely accurately, of the value of children\u2019s innocence, their ability to see things through \u201cuntainted\u201d eyes.</div>",organizzation:" The Tamers of Rivers are among the most scattered and most disparate of the Elemental Masteries. Few live near to their tutors. In the old days, tutors and pupils would only interact when their respective journeys\u2019 paths crossed. In this era of email and cell phones, arranging to meet up in advance is easy. <div>Tamers of Rivers often go out of their way to find pupils. New blood is development, and development is evolution. Because of the peripatetic lifestyles so many of them lead, Tamers of Rivers often have several pupils at any one time, although they might not know that they are not their tutors\u2019 only pupils. Tutors, on the other hand, can be difficult for aspiring Travelers to find. In fact, some gain the right to initial instruction simply through succeeding in finding a tutor. </div><div>Similar to the other Elemental Masteries, tutors explain to their pupils about the theoretical sense of kinship and obligation the Tamers of Rivers have with others who bear the Elemental Mark (including other Tamers of Rivers). In practice, it means that they\u2019re likely to be well-disposed towards most others of the Elemental Masteries, but go no further than that, only really giving as much aid as they want. </div><div>The Tamers of Rivers work well alongside the Tamers of Stone and Tamers of Winds. The Tamers of Winds under stand the Travelers the best out of the Masteries, and while the Tamers of Winds have a very different approach to their watery brethren, the Tamers of Winds have a good grasp of the way that the Tamers of Rivers see truth and change. The Tamers of Rivers and the Tamers of Winds complement each other. The rather cold but measured approach of the Tamers of Winds tempers the emotionalism of the Travelers, whose primal, sensual nature takes the hard edges from the others\u2019 cerebral approach to their magic. </div><div>Tamers of Rivers clash with Tamers of Fire, feeling uneasy with the Champions\u2019 martial attitude, who, in turn, have difficulty with the way that the Tamers of Rivers put themselves at risk. But both Legacies recognize the need for each other among the Elemental Masteries.</div>",suggestedOblations:" Praying or meditating near a perfectly clean spring, riverbank or stretch of seashore.

Progress, however one conceives it, depends upon constant movement. Change is natural. Change is evolution. Change is the nature of water. Water is the most primal, basic element of human physiology. </div><div>Like attracts like. As embodied change, the Tamers of Rivers need to create change. They need to create wholeness, but it\u2019s a certain kind of wholeness they want. Progress for progress\u2019s sake is not, for the Tamers of Rivers, an adequate end in and of itself. Their attitude to progress is something of a paradox. They don\u2019t really want the world to change. In fact, many of them see \u201cprogress\u201d in the classic Victorian sense as a bad thing. The change they seek to create is the amount of change necessary to avoid stagnation. It\u2019s the old saw: you have to change to stay the same; by staying the same, you become better. </div><div>The way the Travelers see it, they\u2019ve always been what human society needed. Tutors in the Tamers of Rivers describe the ancient Legacy as a group dedicated to creating wholeness and beauty through change and growth, through the fertility of water, through encouraging the acceptance of sexuality and through the healing power of water. </div><div>In ancient Greece, the Tamers of Rivers identified the central, symbolic River from which they drew their powers with Oceanus, the personification of the enormous river that they believed circled the world-disc. Oceanus\u2019 consort was his sister Tethys, and from their union came the three thousand Oceanids, the ocean nymphs from whom flowed all the rivers of the world. </div><div>As a mystical sign, some Tamers of Rivers did at one point follow the example of the Ur-River-God and married their siblings. The practice died out long ago, but even so, there are quite persistent and pernicious rumors among the Awakened about the Travelers\u2019 sexual proclivities, even now, hundreds of years after the practice has been abandoned. </div><div>Having once entered the River of Oceanus, the Travelers cannot help but find themselves encircled by its waters. Encircled, they remain islands. They are like the adventurers and explorers of old, who return from distant lands filled with new visions and experiences, to find that the world without them has remained exactly as they left it, and that friends and family can no longer understand them.</div> <h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Flow of Time</h3> <div>Over the centuries, the fortunes of the Tamers of Rivers have ebbed and flowed like the waters of the seas. The Travelers, they say, were the first of the Elemental Masteries. Some even claim that they were the first of the Awakened. </div><div>The lore of the Travelers, passed down over eons, tells that once, the Mainland Peoples lived in peaceful, goddessworshiping matriarchal societies. Here, before there was any Quiescence, the Tamers of Rivers were highly respected. The first Tamers of Rivers were all women. Although they left the management of communities to the Grandmothers, their word carried a great deal of influence. They trained healers and midwives, moving from community to community as and when they were needed. </div><div>Sleeper historians, even those on the very edges, have lost the records of this caste. Even in the putative matriarchal societies suggested by radical historians, women stayed where they were. The evidence of the Travelers has gone, wiped out by the Quiescence and the machinations of the Exarchs. </div><div>The Atlanteans brought patriarchy to the Mainland. They sailed across the sea in their bright ships with painted sails, and they brought violence and control to the world. And they seized the Supernal Realms for their own, too. The Watchtowers were a means of control, the Travelers say, a means of keeping people out of the Supernal just as much as they were a means of access. Five obscene phallic monstrosities standing there, overlooking eternity, heralding the end of peace. As above, so below: the Atlanteans brought patriarchy to the world of humans and imposed the same patriarchy on the realms of magic. The Tamers of Rivers watched and wept, as all they had cared for fell before the ravening legions of conquest from the West. They felt no satisfaction as the harbingers of violent control overstretched themselves and destroyed their own home. </div><div>Still, the Quiescence hit the Tamers of Rivers hard. They still clung to their old ways, but without the fanfare, hiding among the midwives and healers who once had revered them and sat at their feet. Things change. The orders were the future of the Awakened, and eventually, the Elemental Masteries, including the Travelers, joined them. </div><div>The civilizations of the Middle East and the Mediterranean grew apace. The Tamers of Rivers, adapting as best they could to the new patriarchies and the mechanistic worldview they engendered, continued in the same traditional women\u2019s roles. </div><div>Some joined the goddess-cults that remained, seeing in them the opportunity to gain some kind of respect. It was in this era that the first men joined the Legacy. These were eunuchs, male temple prostitutes and cup-bearers, the kind of men whose masculinity had been removed or violated, who were disenfranchised as men. </div><div>The age of the Greek city-states brought nautical trade to Europe, and allowed them to travel. The Peloponnesian War ended the era, but brought into being a need for the healing hands of the Tamers of Rivers. The common language and social upheaval brought by Philip and Alexander\u2019s conquests and the Succession Wars made it easy to move from community to community across the Mediterranean and the Middle East, and again, the ravages of war meant that there was a constant need for healers, traders, teachers \u2014 and midwives. They rode the wave of the flourishing of art and literature of the Hellenistic era. </div><div>In time, Rome superseded the Hellenistic nations. The Pax Romana gave the Travelers more reason to travel. The rise of the mystery religions allowed the Tamers of Rivers unprecedented freedom. The priestesses of the Mysteries, of Cybele, the Eleusinian Cult and Isis, gave an Awakened woman the chance to cross great differences and gain a kind of tarnished respect in a world where women had little chance to travel or learn. Some took common cause with the Christians, who, during the days of their persecution, treated all of the disenfranchised \u2014 women, slaves, the conquered \u2014 with compassion and equality. Some of the Gnostics, particularly those who respected the Magdalene, Awakened. A large proportion joined the Travelers. By the time the Christians had gained the upper hand and had become the controlling religion of the Empire, they were no different from any other establishment religion. The sect that the Tamers of Rivers had favored was anathematized and wiped out. </div><div>The Empire ended in flames and humiliation, but the Tamers of Rivers continued. In the new world of the Middle Ages, their constant travel kept them safe in a world where few people ever went further than 20 miles from their homes. The Middle Ages allowed them to find new recruits from the outsiders of the world. </div><div>It goes on. They hid from the Church within the Church, at times taking on the part of nuns and saints. If some were hanged or drowned as witches, they hid well enough, and were few in number compared to the innocent Christians who were killed by mistake. </div><div>Tamers of Rivers traveled to the New World. They met others who had formed comparable traditions in the Americas, in Africa, in the Antipodes. </div><div>All the time, their numbers dwindled, slowly, inexorably, until the second half of the 18th century, when a sea change in Western philosophy and vast upheavals in the political landscape made people see themselves and each other differently. This created a vast potential for more change. The horrors of the 20th century changed the Tamers of Rivers. True, the emancipation of women in the Western world and the change of social mores that happened after the Second World War gave them more freedom, more chances to be part of Sleeper society, but the wars themselves gave them cause to fear. Two apocalypses, so close together. The loss of a whole generation of European men, and the loss of faith that followed, the loss of a social compass, the loss of a way forward, the death of compassion. And the Holocaust, the bomb. Suddenly progress and change sped up, and not for the good. </div><div>Many Tamers of Rivers are idealists. They truly believe that the world can be made that much better, if only enough people can be encouraged to change. But they also know that their vision is ultimately doomed to failure. </div><div>No matter what a Tamer of Rivers does, there\u2019s always the suspicion in her heart of hearts that she\u2019s on a highway to nothing, that the world is going to hell. The air\u2019s getting warmer. There are holes in the sky. The waters are vanishing. The River\u2019s running dry. </div><div>The Tamers of Rivers recruit the kind of people who have dreams of a better world. They want the compassionate people. They want women and men who are able to stand for the right of people to live and love and create. But these very people are the ones who can\u2019t live in this world. Every day the news bombards them with tales of corporate excesses, armies of liberation resorting to torture, sweatshops and cola wars, the death of 1,000 children every day from hunger caused by negligence and war. The AIDS epidemic. Poverty in the developing world. Simple, plain selfishness. </div><div>As the world lurches forward to destruction, as the River, the Ocean, flows ever more sluggishly, clogged with oil, refuse and blood, the Tamers of Rivers struggle to keep their spirit. </div><div>The Travelers keep traveling. They keep fighting their corner, working their magic, trying to change what little they can, so that the Sleepers can survive unharmed. It\u2019s the best they can do.</div> <h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2> <div>When Tamers of Rivers choose their pupils, it\u2019s often a snap decision. Some Travelers decide they need pupils (perhaps they\u2019re lonely; perhaps they just think it\u2019s time). Others might not even contemplate teaching someone of their own until one day, they meet a mage whose very appearance transforms their lives, and pow, there they are with a pupil. However it works out, the pupil gets the choice to join, although by the time that her prospective tutor has even begun to explain to her who the Tamers of Rivers are, the pupil in all likelihood knows if she is destined to follow the flow of the River to its final outlet. An aspirant who wants to join the Legacy has to find a tutor, just like any other mage who joins a Legacy. The problem is that a mage who moves around as much as a Tamer of Rivers does can be very difficult to pin down. </div><div>There follows a period of purgation and cleansing. The Tamer of the River has to experience a letting-go of some aspects of her former life. She changes her name again. And she gives something up. Maybe it\u2019s a home, or a treasured possession. Maybe it\u2019s a relationship. </div><div>With all things stripped away, the Tamer of Rivers travels to a river with her tutor, and the more experienced mage helps her to undress. Naked, she enters the river. The tutor baptizes her, and holds her head under the water until she very nearly drowns. In the split second between living and entering into the afterlife, the new pupil becomes one with the River, with every watercourse in the world, with every sea, with every flow of blood and fluid in every living thing, all at once. She becomes the Water, and she becomes change. She becomes transformation. She bursts out of the water into the arms of her tutor, gulping in air, crying her heart into her tutor\u2019s arms, having become something both other than human and more human than before. </div><div>She returns with the tutor, possessed of what feels like a new mind. New thoughts and new desires well up within her. She changes, becomes different in some way. The change might be physical. Her eyes could have changed color, from brown to blue. Maybe she\u2019s thin where once she was overweight. The change could be in her social nature, in her desires. Perhaps her sexuality has changed. Maybe she needs to touch people when she speaks to them. The change could be mental. Perhaps she\u2019s lost some of the memories of her childhood, replaced with memories of something older and stranger. Maybe her opinions of some people or things have changed utterly. Maybe there\u2019s someone she once loved, whom now she has entirely forgotten. The core of her being hasn\u2019t really changed: she still has the same Virtue and the same Vice, for example, and her soul is the same soul, only it\u2019s a soul that knows it is one with the River. It\u2019s a soul that embraces change and continuing travel. </div><div>She\u2019s a Tamer of Rivers now. When it is time to gain a new Attainment, she returns to the water. Either she finds her tutor, and they do this again, or, having left her tutor behind \u2014 and it\u2019s in the nature of a Traveler to move on \u2014 she goes into the water alone. Immersed in the River, she becomes more like the water each time. Each time, she moves on a little, and each time she has to give another thing up, maybe another memory, or a lover, or a home, maybe even a name. With each change, she begins again as a slightly different person. Neither the tutor or the pupil knows what the River\u2019s going to take (although a Traveler with a degree of self-knowledge might be able to guess). That\u2019s up to the River.</div>",magic:"<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Magic</h2> The Tamers of Rivers use water in all of their magics. This isn\u2019t always obvious. In the philosophy of the Elemental Masteries, water is change, and the abstract theme of change is as prevalent as actual magic. There is water in the air, and water in the human body. Many Tamers of Rivers learns how to cast their instant spells by reaching into the water that permeates all things, even in some of the driest places in the world, and manipulating it, duplicating it by bonding atoms of hydrogen and oxygen, driving it, pushing it, changing it. The Travelers often use water in their extended castings in a more obvious way, using vials of purified water, homeopathic solutions and basins of fresh rain water to achieve the effects they look for.<div>Many Tamers of Rivers have familiars. Usually, they find an affinity with waterfowl, who travel across the world every year and understand the ways of the River. Many Tamers of Rivers seek out the Caladrius, the rare, near-mythical Healing-Bird, to give them company and aid.</div>",attainmentsDescrizione:"The Travelers reach into elemental water, effecting physical changes in its substance and using it as a tool.

When we came out into the open air, we built shelters in which to live, temples in which to worship, edifices in which to bury our dead. As time went on, the buildings became more ornate, more impressive, more intricately designed. The Pyramids. The Mausoleum at Halicarnassus. The Temple of Zeus at Olympia. The Gates of Palmyra. The Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. The Colossus of Rhodes. The Hanging Gardens. The Lal Qila at Delhi. Machu Picchu. The Colosseum. The Great Wall of China. The Taj Mahal. St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral. The Empire State Building. </div><div>The hands that built them were manifold. The architects may have been well-known, but the unsung thousands who actually made these grand structures were just as important. Theirs was not the inspiration. Theirs was not the design, theirs was not the grand conceit. Theirs was the craft. Theirs was the work of their hands, the honest toil, the skill and the sweat. </div><div>The Tamers of Stone were there. Although the self-styled \u201cCraftmasons\u201d have always trained their students to know the theory of design and the grand geometry of architecture, the Craftmasons have also instructed their own to get their hands dirty. The Awakened may have had no part in the design of the great architectural wonders of human history, but they were there in the act of building, and they were there in the building itself. They joined the common man on the ground. </div><div>The Tamers of Fire take the role of those born to lead. The Tamers of Rivers bring change and healing. The Tamers of Winds all distinguish themselves through their endless urge to know. But the Tamers of Stone blend in with the anonymous masses. All people are equal, the Craftmasons say. The Awakened have no right to treat the Sleepers as instruments, for they are as human as the Awakened. In these times, the Craftmasons represent and quietly protect the common man. </div><div>Humanity came from earth, and to earth every man and woman shall return. It\u2019s the basis of human life. Earth is sensation: the stones know and recall every foot that walked across them, every hammer and chisel that worked them. The stones have stories to tell, if only one will have the patience to ask them. The Tamers of Stone understand this. They craft their souls to the extent that they perceive that they are earth, they are stone. And for them, stone is creation and perception. </div><div>For them, stone is incarnation in the flesh, the means by which the One God, Urizen, the Demiurge or whatever, pulled Adam out of the ground. Stone is humanity, the common thread that links all men together. </div><div>Earth is incarnation: the stones are solid. The stones survive when the fire has burnt out, when the flood has dried out, when the wind has passed away. The stones remain. The Tamers of Stone bring the solidity and quiet observation of the earth to the Elemental Masteries. The Craftmasons stand among the Sleepers, protecting them and serving them. Capable of magics both subtle and spectacular, the Tamers of Stone know the magic means nothing if they can\u2019t play their part in human society. </div><div>The Sleepers are beset on all sides. Their cites are choked with the hungry, sneering dead, who prey on their blood, by shapeshifters, who tear them to shreds and dine on their flesh, by ghosts and spirits and demons and worse things and, most of all, by the other Awakened. The Tamers of Stone might care little for tales of cosmic struggles between Exarchs and Oracles, but the Craftmasons have no time for those who would exploit the Sleepers and keep them from Awakening. Apparently humble the Tamers of Stone may be, but as many would-be tyrants have discovered, the hand of the common man can be a powerful weapon.</div>",alternateNickname:"Craftmasons",orders:" The Tamers of Stone aren\u2019t equally represented in the Pentacle. Some members of the Adamantine Arrow see a common cause with the Craftmasons, and seek to join their number, seeing the battle as vital. The Guardians of the Veil want to keep the Sleepers unaware of magic. They preserve their paranoid hierarchies and keep the magic under lock and key. They have no time for the Tamers of Stone, and few join, although, occasionally, there is the mage who sees the edifice the Guardians would build as a castle, not a prison. Members of the Mysterium, who seek knowledge above all, often find it hard to appreciate the Craftmasons\u2019 obsession with the Sleepers. Can knowledge be found among ordinary people? Can knowledge be gained from getting your hands dirty? There are a very few Mysterium members for whom the answers to those questions are \u201cyes,\u201d and they are not hostile to the idea of joining the Tamers of Stone.<div>The Silver Ladder, on the other hand, supplies many of the Craftmasons\u2019 pupils. The idealists who form a large part of the Silver Ladder\u2019s membership see the Craftmasons\u2019 ideals as completely in harmony with their own. The same goes for the Free Council, who include among their number craftsmen and political radicals, who see the soulcrafting of the Tamers of Stone as a simple continuation of their magical journey.</div>",appearance:" The Craftmasons look as if they work hard.<div>Their clothes are practical, and their hands are the hands of manual laborers. Their faces catch the sun and they\u2019re often in good shape, although their physical condition is clearly due to rough manual work rather than working out in a gym, just as their tans are the uneven, deep tans of the navy rather than the shiny, glowing tan that comes from lounging on a beach or lying under a sun bed. </div><div>The Elemental Mark manifests itself on a Craftmason\u2019s nimbus, just as it does with all of the members of the Elemental Masteries. The nimbus of a Tamer of Stone appears to affect the area around him. The substance of common things might appear to take on life, or a personality. The Tamer of Stone\u2019s skin might appear to develop the texture of roughly chiseled stone. Or he might appear to be an everyman, taking on the aspect of every human being alive, just for a second, from the lowest to the highest, provoking a moment of recognition in everyone.</div>",background:" Tamers of Stone often come from workingclass or blue-collar backgrounds. Some have higher educational qualifications, but they still mostly come from technical and manual fields. As long as the mage is involved in manual labor of some kind, she\u2019s welcome. The Tamers of Stone include among their number decorators, carpenters, glaziers, roofers, architects, civil engineers and farmers, but the vast majority of Tamers of Stone work in construction, and perform their magic within that context. The nature of their everyday work means that most Tamers of Stone are male, although there are no prohibitions against women joining the Legacy, and few prejudices among their number.",organizzation:"The Tamers of Stone are the most organized of the Elemental Masteries. Since the Middle Ages, they\u2019ve been loosely arranged into regional Lodges, which work together to support each other. Just as in all the Elemental Masteries, tutors approach potential pupils, particularly choosing bluecollar mages with a talent for manual craftsmanship. Although each pupil only has one tutor, members of each Lodge take part in the training of newer Tamers of Stone. The tutor-pupil relationship is the only relationship among the Craftmasons that admits any kind of hierarchy, and even then, tutors and pupils are notionally equal: the idea is that the tutor is not imparting knowledge from above, but sharing it from a position of experience, so that the pupil may one day be brought up to speed, with the purpose of effecting true equality among the Tamers of Stone.<div>In practice, however, people are people, and although the Tamers of Stone are supposed to be completely equal, many Lodges suffer from political machinations among their members, as each tries hard to be first among equals. </div><div>There are still a lot of Tamers of Stone. They\u2019re a relatively numerous Legacy. Among the Elemental Masteries, only the Tamers of Rivers even come near them in numbers, and even then, they\u2019re fewer. The Tamers of Stone are the blue-collar journeymen of the Elemental Masteries. Thus, the Craftmasons outnumber the others, many of whom (particularly the Tamers of Fire and Tamers of Winds) come from more privileged, educated backgrounds. </div><div>The Tamers of Stone work well with the other Elemental Masteries. Although the Tamers of Fire, with their heroic nature, can be autocratic, they often need a cause to be heroes for. Tamers of Stone who work in cabals alongside the Champions ground the Tamers of Fire and give them direction. Conversely, the Tamers of Rivers bring compromise to cabals that include Tamers of Stone. Like the constant flow of water eroding the rock, the Tamers of Rivers work to erode the sharp edges from the Craftmasons\u2019 hard resolve and create something more harmonious. The Tamers of Winds often clash with the Tamers of Stone \u2014 the Craftmasons find the Tamers of Winds\u2019 tendency to stand in judgment over others patronizing and elitist. Still, both Legacies recognize that they have a role to play and notwithstanding their reservations, they often work together and work together well, the straightforwardness of the Tamers of Stone complementing the more cerebral nature of their airy counterparts.</div>",suggestedOblations:" Single-handedly building a cairn made of large stones.

",historySocietyCulture:"<h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>History and Culture</h2> <div>The Tamers of Stone began, just as all of the Elemental Masteries, as people who took on a role within society. The Tamers in Stone were the craftsmen who built, who carved the pediments, who erected the pillars, who kept the blocks of the Great Pyramid straight and flush. For the longest time, they were ignored, with few to represent them among the Awakened. The Tamers of Stone, who took their place among the workers, knew their place and joined them in humility and obscurity. </div><div>There were a lot of them. Some Legacies have never been all that numerous, but as Legacies go, the Tamers of Stone have always had the weight of numbers. </div><div>Over time, craftsmen developed guilds. The guilds took on their own character, and craftsmen took pride in their work. The craftsmen grew wealthy. The result was that the Tamers of Stone, who lived and worked their magics among those craftsmen, gradually became politicized. As time went on, they began to develop the view that all men, who came from the earth, were equal. Mages who retreated into their own shadow world found it easy to forget the worth of the Sleepers. But the Craftmasons, who spent their time among the Sleepers and who knew them as friends and family, could not discount them. An Awakened human being is still a human being, and the Tamers of Stone felt that they were doing well to remember it. </div><div>They fought for their truth. </div><div>They began to bear grudges. One particularly sore point concerns the fate of the Diggers. Between 1649 and 1650, carried along in the wake of the Civil War, several groups of the so-called True Levellers, a pacifist and anarchist movement, began to set up land-working communities on common land across England. Although John Lilburne, the founder of the Diggers, was a Sleeper, several Tamers of Stone were part of the movement and believed in its aims. Landowners and community leaders abhorred what they saw as an affront to public order (and a way for poor men to escape paying rent to the large landowners). The reprisals began almost immediately, and the Diggers were finished by 1651. Every time a colony of Diggers began, the authorities crushed it, sometimes with court actions, and mostly with actual violence. </div><div>Beneath this social conflict lay another, esoteric clash. The Tamers of Stone who had been part of this movement found themselves, as their Sleeper companions were dispersed, betrayed into the hands of the Seers of the Throne on every occasion. The Tamers of Stone never proved that the Guardians of the Veil were behind it, but circumstantial evidence \u2014 rumors, letters, entries in diaries \u2014 suggested that mages belonging to the Guardians of the Veil had sold the Tamers of Stone out, feeding information of their supposed allies\u2019 activities to Seer spies. The Seers were always one step ahead of the Tamers of Stone. In England, hardly any got out of the 17th century alive, and although their numbers would grow again in later centuries, the English Tamers of Stone would never forget what had happened, long after the Guardians responsible, who had likely only betrayed their allies as a political expedient, had died out. </div><div>The 17th century was a turning point for the Tamers of Stone. After that time, they remained the most political of the Elemental Masteries, with a general philosophy that, unlike the others, extended beyond the crafting of souls. </div><div>In the 18th century, Tamers of Stone were present among the Radical Dissenters, and took part in the revolutions in France and the American colonies. They were there within the movement for slaves\u2019 emancipation. In the 19th century, they fought on both sides of the American Civil War, with those on the side of the North fighting for the slaves, and those in the South fighting for independence. By the beginning of the 20th century, there were many Craftmasons who had taken to heart the ethos of the Socialist International, joining with labor movements and communist parties across Europe. Tamers of Stone took roles in post-revolutionary Russia. When the Communist dream ended, there were Tamers of Stone taking hammers to the Berlin Wall with the rejoicing thousands. </div><div>The socialist and communalist ideals of the Tamers of Stone have received several blows during the last two decades, particularly in Western Europe and the United States, but even so, they still exist and in large numbers. Wherever there are working men, there the Tamers of Stone are, mucking in.</div> <h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Day Job</h3> <div>As mages go, the Tamers of Stone are exceptionally grounded in everyday life. </div><div>Mages who eschew close relationships with Sleepers are safer, but gradually, such mages forget what it was like to be a Sleeper. They lose their empathy with the Sleepers. The mages no longer see the Sleepers as really human in the way that the Awakened are. The Elemental Masteries in general and the Tamers in Stone in particular prefer to retain their ties, and in the case of the Craftmasons, this means holding down a day job, and doing it well. </div><div>Holding down a day job holds all kinds of complications for a mage. Many manage it, and do just fine. The Tamers of Stone depend upon it. They see remaining at work part of the work of taming their souls. </div><div>This can appear to be quite limiting for characters. Actually, it\u2019s a rich vein of complication and plot devices, just waiting to be mined. </div><div>The building trade, where most of the Craftmasons work, can be quite peripatetic. Workers in years past used to travel to where the work was. While that doesn\u2019t happen so much now, in some countries builders still move from town to town, taking on short-term construction work. A mage in this industry could be a valuable resource for a cabal, who could travel with him. The pay isn\u2019t going to feed all the mouths, but it offers a grounding for a group who can move on when he does. Another mage could be a self-employed building contractor. His fellow mages could work within the trade alongside him, meaning that they all have a means of support and a reason to stick together. </div><div>Colleagues can produce all sorts of plot complications, mystical and mundane. Even building sites have their leaders, their bullies, their good guys, their slackers and their bosses. A place of work has a ready-made supporting cast with their own concerns, and their own lives. Maybe some of them get involved, unknowing in the mage\u2019s \u201cafter-hours\u201d life. What if one, entirely coincidentally, runs into his Awakened colleague and witnesses the mage doing vulgar magic? The co-worker might Disbelieve it, but there\u2019s still that niggling doubt there, that suspicion that something is wrong. What if one of the mage\u2019s work colleagues suddenly Awakens? What if she Awakens while at work? </div><div>Even if they don\u2019t, the soap opera of the workplace can make a welcome change of pace from rampaging spirits, insane magical conspiracies and monstrous creatures of the night. Workplace romances, issues with pay, industrial action and personal clashes can make stories all the richer.</div> <h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2> <div>Tamers of Stone often choose their pupils, although the process of gaining a pupil is a little more involved than it is with some of the other Elemental Masteries, since a tutor who decides that he wishes to ask a pupil to join the Legacy (or wishes to accept an applicant) must first return to his Lodge and put it to the vote. </div><div>The Lodge members usually vote yes. It\u2019s often, but not always, a foregone conclusion, since new members are always welcome, regardless of their apparent quality. The tutor approaches his prospective pupil and explains to him the Legacy\u2019s philosophy and its practices in brief, giving the less experienced mage the opportunity to turn down the privilege, if finding out more has changed her mind. </div><div>The first stage of soulcrafting begins with a building. Under the tutor\u2019s direction, the pupil must spend several days building a small edifice out of plaster and brick. Having completed it, he steps inside. And then the tutor bricks his pupil inside. The pupil has to leave the building behind. He exercises his affinity with the earth and with the dimensions of the earth. He speaks to it. He perceives it from every angle. And then he becomes the earth. </div><div>What follows is impossible. The mage folds himself into the earth and, having succeeded in escaping, draws himself to his feet behind the building, leaving the brick coffin undisturbed. It\u2019s a feat that a mage shouldn\u2019t be able to do until he\u2019s at least an Adept of Space, and yet, just once, the mage over-reaches himself, and transforms himself into stone and incarnation. </div><div>On the occasion that he gains each subsequent Attainment, the trainee Craftmason makes a new escape from a similar conundrum. Each time he gains a new insight into the nature of the earth: he is the earth. He is the ground. Each time, to escape, he perceives that and folds himself through his own body , turning himself inside out and remaking his soul in the process.</div>",magic:"<h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Magic</h2> <div>The magic of the Tamers of Stone depends upon craftsmanship.

Air, in the philosophical parlance of the Elemental Masteries, is the same as enlightenment. Air is reason. Air is knowledge.

That\u2019s Taming the Winds. </div><div>The mages who have, over the centuries, made this their pursuit meditate on the glimpses they receive of the truth. Glimpses of the truth are preserved in memory. Memory is the ground on which thought builds itself. The Tamers of Winds have always grown thought from memory. Except that memory is a different thing to what it once was. </div><div>Since the invention of the gramophone, the camera and the film reel, humans have had the ability to record facts as they happen. Suddenly, human memory has been made inadequate, superseded by simple technology. In the space of 100 years, facts became prevalent over truth in a million different ways. </div><div>The invention of instant recording changed the human psyche more thoroughly than any other invention. The Tamers of Winds are in a unique position. Their soulcrafting is of the same stripe as the soulcrafting of the ancients, but the practitioners of the Legacy, being mortal, have all been born into a world where these things exist. They have the psychological makeup of people who take cameras, video and sound recording for granted. The result is that the Tamers of Winds exist in a strange kind of tension. On the one hand, they have always known that the facts don\u2019t necessary hold the truth, and might in fact obscure the truth. On the other hand, they\u2019re of a generation that takes without question recording media as the refinement of memory. </div><div>The truth will out, they say. The Tamers of Winds are counting on that. There are Tamers of Winds who seek the truth through the media, aiming to capture small truths perfectly through the medium of film and sound. There are Tamers of Winds who work in law, who seek the truth from human accounts. There are others who work their magic through symbolic truth, using literature of various kinds as their conduit. Others still work as journalists, either professionally for newspapers and magazines, or as simple recorders of facts for the mystical orders they work for. And then there are Tamers of Winds who work in neurology and the field of cybernetics, whose intent is to do nothing less than improve the human brain, to create a perfect memory, not just for facts, but for the truth.</div>",alternateNickname:"Aeolians",orders:"Many Tamers of Winds have their origins in the Free Council, particularly those Tamers who have no problem working magic through technology.

While the Aeolians hold no especial attraction for the Adamantine Arrow, there is no real reason why an Arrow would not  join the Tamers of Winds either, and certainly, several prominent Tamers of Winds have come from the Arrows. </div><div>The Guardians of the Veil, however, don\u2019t tend to find the Tamers of Winds an attractive option. The Tamers of Winds make all this noise about seeking the truth, but they\u2019re not careful whom they show it to. Making the truth public to everyone, Sleeper and Awakened, terrifies and angers the Guardians of the Veil. As a result, very few Tamers of Winds come from the Guardians of the Veil.</div>",appearance:" Most Tamers of Winds dress smartly, but then most are professionals, holding down professional jobs, and they look the part.

Their eyes move around, assessing their surroundings. <div>The Elemental Mark that changes their nimbus carries with it the twin markers of inpiration and air. It might be that a powerful wind comes from nowhere. It might be that the smell of ozone suddenly fills the area around the Aeolian\u2019s body.</div>",background:" The Tamers of Winds used to come in large numbers from the priestly castes in ancient societies. In history, the churches of different civilizations have been the keepers of truth \u2014 and the keepers of the money. In the West, the tradition continued with the Christian churches, who owned huge amounts of land in Europe. In the last couple of hundred years, that\u2019s changed, as the money has moved from the priestly to the professional.  <div>Many Aeolians are educated professionals, particularly in fields that require inquiry and investigation: science and technology, law, law enforcement, theology and philosophy, and journalism are particularly common professions among the Tamers of Winds.</div>",organizzation:"When a Tamer of Winds sees someone he wants to teach, he sends the prospective pupil a long document. Traditionally, it was handwritten. Now, it is just as likely to be typed, or even put on a DVD or CD. The document tells the pupil why the tutor is offering this  opportunity, what the Legacy has to offer and what the difficulties are. The document has no return address, and is unsigned. Voices and pictures on audio or video media are doctored to hide identities.  <div>It\u2019s up to the pupil to find the sender. Only then can she reach the point of initiation. A potential pupil who wants to join the Legacy, on the other hand, and who approaches a member of the Legacy, usually has to pass a test. It might involve finding some hidden fact that has escaped the tutor for years. Or it might mean that the aspirant has to find something out about the tutor that has been hidden for a long time.  </div><div>Once initiated into the Legacy, the new Tamer of Winds only really has an obligation to her tutor. The Tamers of Winds take the tutor-pupil relationship very seriously and work very closely. Most correspond at least once a day. Just as with the other Elemental Masteries, the Tamers of Winds theoretically have a duty to provide aid to those who carry the Elemental Mark, but in practice, although they might be well disposed toward other Tamers, they\u2019re not really obliged to support them.  </div><div>Tamers of Winds work well with some of the Elemental Masteries. The Tamers of Winds\u2019 endless search for the truth leads them to fan the flames of the Tamers of Fire and to stir the Tamers of Rivers to action and change. The Tamers of the Cave confuse the Tamers of Wind, however. The few Tamers of Winds who meet a Tamer of the Cave find these prophets of the Void to be impossible to understand: their truth is so vague, so inchoate that it is barely comprehensible to the Tamers of Wind.  </div><div>The Tamers of Stone annoy the Tamers of the Wind. The Aeolians would see humans raised to a higher level, given a gift of truth through perfect memory. The Tamers of Winds sometimes get the impression that the Tamers of Stone would rather drag the world down to their level. Still, as members of the Elemental Masteries, the Tamers of Winds still recognize their commonality, although things may change, as the Tamers of Winds go further down the road to perfected memory.</div>",suggestedOblations:"Taking apart a DVD player and put it back together again.

Although given over to the Air, that most mobile of elements, the use of their weather magic encouraged farming, and hence staying in place. As they developed into an institutional priesthood, they began also to record lore. They wrote some of the first histories, and began to promote the arts as a means of teaching. </div><div>It became apparent to these first Tamers of Winds that the truth of history, psychology and philosophy was a slippery thing, not unlike the wind. Similar to the rest of the Elemental Masteries, the Tamers of Winds believed that truth, knowledge and the wind were literally one and the same. They crafted their souls to exploit that \u201cfact,\u201d becoming wind, becoming knowledge, becoming truth. </div><div>As things got worse for the other mages after the Fall, the Aeolians retreated into academia, becoming lorekeepers, priests and librarians. They promoted literacy, traveled little and kept the winds from destroying their homes. They retreated into the shadow world of the mages, joining the orders, particularly the Mysterium. </div><div>And so they remained, for thousands of years, until the Enlightenment. The great truths changed then, and human politics transformed itself. In Europe, the Tamers of Winds, without really trying, changed the way they thought, the same way that everyone else did. But in the 19th century, everything changed.</div> <h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Facts and Truths</h3> <div>Until the invention of instant recording media, all history depended upon human hands and human memories. History books were written by those who recorded accounts of what people recalled. </div><div>Memory was fallible. Everyone knew memory was fallible. It was a world in which four contradictory Gospels could be included in the Bible, and all of them thought to be true, because truth wasn\u2019t supposed to be about immutable facts. </div><div>Truth was about eternal verities, regardless of facts. Facts were just things that happened, and that people remembered and forgot. It was supposed to be about what was true. Truth went beyond simple facts. To the historians of ancient Greece, something didn\u2019t have to have happened in order to be true. Herodotus and Thucydides gave accounts of great speeches that were never given, but that were no less a true encapsulation of the great statesmen\u2019s positions. Livy rewrote the early history of Rome from hearsay and dimly remembered oral traditions, choosing those facts that he regarded as true because they fit what he believed the order of things should be. </div><div>Facts and truth were not the same, and both were impossible for fallible humans to capture. Throughout the ages, the past was only a matter of memory, of hearsay and opinion. Although, when the Age of Reason arrived, the great thinkers of the day tried to deny this, claiming that facts could be nailed down, they tried in vain. </div><div>And then, in 1826, Nic\xe9phore Ni\xe9pce invented the first photographic plate. When, eight years later, Louis Daguerre patented the daguerreotype, the history of thought changed. Suddenly, people could capture a moment, as it was, with only the light and the chemicals on the photographic plate as intermediaries. </div><div>In 1877, Edison patented the phonograph, and now words could recorded as they were said. A few years later, the movie camera appeared. And in the 1920s, film and sound were brought together. </div><div>Suddenly, the actions of people could be recorded. Suddenly, facts could be captured, and memory did not need to be relied upon. </div><div>During the course of the 20th century, facts and truth became conflated, a dangerous business in a world where propaganda was an art form. </div><div>The Tamers of Winds found themselves just as fascinated by these new technologies as everyone else. Cameras and film gave the Tamers of Winds factual material from which to find truth. To their frustration, truths became just as elusive, and were still locked in the human soul. </div><div>Facts are easy to find, but facts can be untrue. Facts can obscure more important things. The truth doesn\u2019t always out.</div> <h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Bleeding Edge</h3> <div>Some Tamers of Winds have entered the field of neurology and cybernetics. They\u2019re convinced that if human memory can be \u201cfixed,\u201d humanity can become more perfect, more whole. </div><div>Aeolian researchers have made breakthroughs in the use of drugs and hypnosis, but they have not yet found that holy grail, the means of making memory perfect. </div><div>There are rumors of institutions run by Aeolians, whose desire to fix people has led them to magically experiment \u2014 even operate \u2014 on Sleepers\u2019 brains, not always with their consent. </div><div>Like attracts like.

A period of guided meditation in the company of the tutor encourages the potential Aeolian to enter a trance state. And then the tutor makes her jump. </div><div>The question of whether she literally jumps or not is never settled. The Tamers of Wind do not allow recording equipment of any kind. The pupil feels the rush of air, the impact of the ground, the crush of bones \u2014 and then she wakes up, still sitting in the high place, where she was before she jumped. </div><div>Did she dream it? Did she jump? If she did, how did she get back here? She has an epiphany. She jumped and she did not jump, and both are true statements. She is a Tamer of Winds now, and she is wind, and she is truth. </div><div>Not everyone makes it through the initiation. Every so often, though, there\u2019s a rumor of an Acanthus mage who leaps off a tall building and ends up a smear on the sidewalk. </div><div>The second and third Attainments of the Wind depend upon further initiations. Both involve paradoxes, things that didn\u2019t happen and yet which happened while the mage was in a guided trance. One Aeolian starves to death and feels himself eaten by crows. One feels his tutor\u2019s knife twisting between his ribs. Each time, the epiphany of truth in paradox is enough to cross the mage over the threshold of the next Attainment.</div>",magic:"<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Magic</h2> <div>The magic of the Tamers of Winds controls manifestations of the Air, both the elemental force and the truth it can sometimes be.

Tamers of Wind are masters of creating magics that investigate the truth of a thing. </div><div>The Tamers of Wind cast both kinds of magic swiftly. They favor short castings and make heavy use of rote mudras (see Mage: The Awakening,  p. 125): the air does not wait, they say.

They chained the storm-wind in their bellows to send it roaring into the furnace. Kissed by the fire\u2019s ardor, dull ore sweated drops of shining metal. The smith shaped this metal with hammer and tongs, and then quenched it in water. A hundred useful things came from the forge: barrel-hoops and buckles, pins and plowshares. The smith knew the secrets of shining silver and heart-gladdening gold, the soft service of copper, tin and lead and the resilience of bronze. Most of all, though, he knew the secrets of iron. Not a pretty metal, but a strong one; the perfect metal for the swords and armor that made one man master over his fellows \u2014 and it fell from the sky. </div><div>Around the world, therefore, common folk and kings saw the smith as a figure of magic \u2014 because, of course, he was. Long before Egypt, Sumer or China, the mages of Atlantis wrought wonders in their forges of power. Smith-gods such as Greek Hephaistos, Celtic Goibniu or Yoruban Ogoun preserve a faint memory of their deeds. The mortal smiths remembered, too. They knew their Art revealed a sacred, Supernal truth: in creating tools, the smith did more than change the substance or shape of matter. He imbued matter with purpose , making it an extension of human thought and human will. This metaphysical change was at least as great and wonderful a miracle as the production of metal from ore. </div><div>In the modern age of factories and mass production, most people forget the awe that once surrounded the Masters of Metal. The miracles have become too commonplace. A few people keep the old ways and the old secrets, though \u2014 sometimes in the very heart of the industrial world that seems to have surpassed the wonder-smiths of yore.

Forge Masters often tool their eyepatch with a personal symbol, as a sort of badge of office. Even when they aren\u2019t working, Forge Masters usually prefer simple, sturdy clothing.

The great Powersmiths of the past are known through the items they enchanted and the personal hallmarks they stamped on their work. The Forge Masters know their Legacy is very old, though, because it occurs wherever people smelt metal from ore. </div><div>In Atlantis, the Forge Masters say, their Legacy did not exist as such. Matter responded to enlightened Will. All mages could do all things if they chose. Some mages simply developed greater skill at working with metal \u2014 and those mages wrought wonders. They also discovered the perfected metals such as orichalcum and lunargent. Some Atlantean artifacts suggest a half-technological magic of devices built from crystals and perfected metals: flying ships powered by sorcerous engines, weapons that fired lightning bolts from crystal rods and many other strange devices. </div><div>When the warring Atlanteans broke the world, the wondersmiths lost their greatest powers. The arts that remained to them, however, seemed mighty enough to simple Sleepers. The Atlanteans and their heirs still wrought wonders that mythology would ascribe to gods and demigods, such as the dwarf-forged hammer Mjollnir, or the maidens of living gold who served Hephaistos. </div><div>As magic faded from the world, the heirs of Atlantis had to re-invent their spells and rely more on mundane artifice. Nevertheless, their power remained great enough that even Sleeper smiths were treated as magicians \u2014 and similar to all magicians, the smiths inspired fear and contempt as well as awe and respect. In many cultures, blacksmith families were deemed of royal or even godly descent. In just as many other cultures, blacksmiths were suspected of knowing curses or called unclean for the sweat and grime of their profession. </div><div>Many of the rotes known to Forge Masters reflect this mythic age. Powersmiths sometimes ascribe their techniques of enchantment to divine smiths such as Hephaistos or Ogoun, the dwarf-smith Alberich and the faerie-smith Wayland or legendary mortals such as Daedalus or Tubalcain. The Forge Masters can point to more than myths, however, as evidence of their presence in the ancient world. Etruscan goldwork, for instance, is sometimes covered with nearly microscopic gold granules somehow soldered on without melting them. A temple in India holds a huge pillar of rustproof cast iron made in a time and place when supposedly neither iron-casting nor rustproof alloys were known. </div><div>Medieval blacksmiths lost a lot of prestige. More of them worked for common people, making everyday tools and implements. Armor and weapons became specialized crafts with their own practitioners. On the other hand, workers in silver and gold such as Cellini became famous as individuals for the first time. The Forge Masters lost prestige among fellow mages, too. </div><div>Perhaps the most momentous change, however, came when blacksmiths started making precision machines. The techniques developed for articulated suits of armor also enabled smiths to craft mechanical toys for royal patrons \u2014 or the first clocks driven by pendulums or springs \u2014 and from there, Forge Masters tell their apprentices, it was only a short step to steam engines. Powersmiths didn\u2019t invent the new technologies \u2014 some may have been involved in particular inventions but their names are forgotten \u2014 but these mages accepted them gladly. Some Forge Masters still specialize in magical machines such as clockwork bodies for spirit familiars to possess, or Arcane seismographs that detect magical disruptions from far away. </div><div>The modern Forge Masters regret the modern world\u2019s hostility to willworking, but not much. Nowadays, they have dozens of metals to combine for just the right alloy, and techniques for shaping metal their mythic forebears could never imagine. The Legacy has its traditionalists who insist a real blacksmith knows when to temper steel by the color of the cooling metal, not a thermometer. Most Powersmiths say, however, that the true artisan always surpasses his tools \u2014 especially when the art is magic. They seek to tame the refractory hardness of tungsten, the lightness of magnesium and beryllium and even the sinister weight of depleted uranium. What magic lurks within the new metals and manufacturing techniques? They don\u2019t know \u2014 but they want to find out.</div> <h2 style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2> <div>The Forge Masters are completely decentralized. They have no offices beyond tutor and pupil. Even their \u201cguilds\u201d are so informal they barely exist. In the Western world at least, no Powersmith has the authority to gainsay another\u2019s judgment about how to train an apprentice or when to bring another mage into the Legacy. By the same token, the Legacy has no serious internal divisions: clashes between members stay personal. </div><div>Less accomplished Forge Masters do show respect for smiths who have progressed further in the Legacy; that\u2019s just good sense. After all, you may need the senior Powersmith\u2019s help to gain your next Attainment, if something happens to your current tutor. More experienced Forge Masters also know trade secrets they may impart if suitably flattered (and a little tipsy). </div><div>Titles are similarly informal. Tutor and pupil are generally called master and apprentice, regardless of their Arcana proficiencies. Once a pupil receives his first Attainment, other Powersmiths may address him as \u201cjourneyman\u201d until he achieves his second Attainment. Forge Masters often assume the names of mythical or legendary smiths such as Sindri (the dwarf who forged Thor\u2019s hammer Mjollnir) or Hua Kuang Fo (the Chinese god of silversmiths and goldsmiths). Personal ancestors who worked with metal are another common choice. </div><div>In other parts of the world, Forge Masters and their guilds may behave more formally. Some cultures still believe in magic and the blacksmith\u2019s special status. In West Africa, for instance, blacksmiths sometimes belong to secret societies devoted to Ogoun (or similar gods). A society that claims a Forge Master as its leader gains great prestige, and Forge Masters themselves show great respect for members with higher Attainments. West African Forge Masters learn a copious body of myths, secret passwords and symbols as they advance from Attainment to Attainment. These secrets include spells and rotes, the names of spirits that may assist or hinder their work and legends about great Forge Masters. All in all, West African Powersmiths take their guilds and ranks quite seriously. </div><div>Whatever their culture, however, the Forge Masters keep a distinctly working-class attitude and sympathies. They do not try to isolate themselves from the common people. Even in places where blacksmith clans claim descent from ancient kings, Forge Masters still work for a living. In West Africa, for instance, the Ogoun societies have become significant advocates for the common people against political or tribal elites \u2014 which puts the local Forge Masters in conflict with mages who cultivate the local ruling classes. </div><div>Powersmiths in the developed world seldom entangle themselves in politics, either among Sleepers or the local Consilium: tutors often advise their pupils that every other mage is a potential client, so it\u2019s best to stay neutral and sell to everyone. Most mages accept the Forge Masters\u2019 neutrality. Not all mages respect the Legacy, though. Mages who get caught up in the \u201cfew and the proud\u201d elitism of being Awakened find the Powersmiths disgracefully common and close to the Sleepers. Such attitudes are perhaps most frequent among the Guardians of the Veil and the worst elements of the Silver Ladder, which exist for domination and control, but every order has its snobs.</div> <h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Powersmiths Among the Seers</h3> <div>Powersmiths, whatever their culture of origin, generally get along with each other. Let two Forge Masters meet and soon they\u2019re talking shop. This amity does not extend to Forge Masters among the Seers of the Throne. Parallel lines of Powersmith initiation have existed among the Seers for as long as the Seers themselves \u2014 and the two sides do not mix. Forge Masters of the Pentacle think of their Seer counterparts as social climbers who\u2019ve chosen the safety of patronage instead of honest work. </div><div>The Seers\u2019 Powersmiths agree. They do have secret arts that place them above the masses. They do serve power. Similar to the legendary wonder-smiths of old, the Seers\u2019 clients are gods, or at least the representatives of gods. They are spiritual kin to the true kings of this world. If other Forge Masters choose to disgrace that divine heritage by grubbing among the common herd, so much the worse for them. </div><div>The two factions loathe each other. Pentacle Forge Masters may stay neutral in Consilium politics, but most are happy to supply arms and armor for attacks upon the Seers.</div> <h3 style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Power of Iron</h3> <div>For centuries, Western scientists doubted that stones and metal fell from the sky, but ancient peoples knew this perfectly well. The Sumerian word for iron loosely translates as \u201cstarstone,\u201d and the Greek \u201csiderite\u201d has the same meaning. The metal from the sky obviously came from the gods and so was used for sacred blades; bits of iron were set in gold like jewels. Even after the Hittites learned to smelt iron, meteoric iron retained special value because of its celestial origin \u2014 plus, iron didn\u2019t rust, a property now ascribed to its nickel content. </div><div>For thousands of years, mortal blacksmiths could not actually liquefy iron. They charged their furnaces with ore and charcoal. Weeks later, they pulled out a spongy mass of iron still mixed with sand, slag and other bits of mineral that wouldn\u2019t burn away. The smith had to hammer these impurities out of the hot metal. </div><div>Blacksmiths thought the spongy iron looked like a plant, so they called it a \u201cbloom.\u201d Every iron-working culture developed the same conceit: iron, and other metals, slowly grew in the earth as a refinement or perfection of common stone. The heat of the furnace accelerated this growth into a higher and purer form; the furnace itself was a man-made womb where the generation of life took place. By speeding the work of nature, surely the smelter had worked magic \u2014 or even seized the fire of divinity itself. </div><div>Iron\u2019s new birth within the furnace did little to reduce the awe attached to the metal from the stars. Homer contrasted \u201cdemocratic iron\u201d with the bronze of aristocrats\u2019 weapons and armor \u2014 but no one ever imagined that bronze would kill spirits or bring luck. Iron retains its mythic role as a symbol of strength and power: no soldier ever received the Titanium Cross. </div><div>Indeed, modern Powersmiths say that science reveals greater depths to iron\u2019s mythic power. Iron is the death of suns: the fusion process that powers stars ends when it reaches iron. </div><div>Building heavier elements consumes energy instead of releasing it. Every element heavier than iron (including the other six mystic metals) is generated when a massive star dies in a supernova explosion, building heavier atoms from the iron in its dead core. One such supernova sparked the creation of the solar system, though, and iron from that dead star enables blood to carry oxygen. </div><div>Some Forge Masters give iron a different primacy. Iron nails held Christ to the Cross. Through the iron of Calvary, a single death led to life eternal. These mages would not deny the stellar significance of iron; seeing connections between theology and astrophysics is just part of being Awakened. </div><div>Whatever their faith, Forge Masters see iron as the greatest of metals. It is the metal of life and death conjoined. Iron gives humanity dominion over nature, and enslaves them to other men. Iron is power itself.</div>",magic:"<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Magic</h2> <div>The Forge Masters see toolmaking as an innately magical act \u2014 the first magic, in fact, practiced long before Atlantis. A tool consists of more than its form and substance. A tool has purpose. Mages can detect that purpose, too, in the form of resonance. Forge Masters believe that when mages enchant objects, they build upon that resonance.</div> <h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Arcana</h3> <div>By the nature of their Legacy, Forge Masters must study Matter and Prime: Matter for changes of form and substance, and Prime for imbuements of power. Of course, they do not limit themselves to those Arcana. All Arcana have value for the spells a Forge Master can imbue into an item, but a few have special value for helping them do their job. </div><div>Fate can link a tool or weapon to a specific person: the item knows its proper owner and does not grant its power to anyone else. More ominously, Forge Masters can create weapons fated to slay particular creatures \u2014 or people. The wonders from a Powersmith\u2019s forge may also carry curses that fall upon people who wield them for improper ends. </div><div>Forces can amplify the impact of a weapon. Once upon a time, Powersmiths forged flaming swords and lightning-javelins for heroes to wield in their battles. Such enchantments are still known; the Paradoxes these weapons attract make them less useful than in days of yore. Forge Masters often study Forces, however, to protect themselves from the terrible heat of their furnaces and the metal they shape. Some ancient recipes for wonder-smithing require the use of an erupting volcano as a forge, as if the Powersmith were Hephaistos himself. </div><div>Spirit, however, is probably the Arcanum most valued by Forge Masters, outside of their Path and Legacy. They don\u2019t care much about spirits per se  (though a few Powersmiths craft fetish items or treat with spirits of mining, smelting or craftsmanship), but Powersmiths need this Arcanum to create orichalcum, lunargent and the other perfected metals they use in their finest work.</div> <h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Perfected Metals</h3> <div>Mortals can speed the work of nature by refining ore into metal; mages can go a step further and smelt away the grosser aspects of matter. These \u201cperfected\u201d metals are closer to the Platonic essence of metal-ness, and therefore accept enchantment more easily. </div><div>Ordinary metals are perfected by repeatedly sending them into Twilight as ephemera and pulling them back to material form. (Some mages think this is the true meaning of the ancient alchemical formula, \u201cDissolve and coagulate.\u201d) Perfecting a metal requires at least two dozen such passages back and forth. The final product has a tenth the volume and mass of the original stock of metal. Only the seven metals known to antiquity can be perfected: gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, lead and mercury. </div><div>Perfected gold, or orichalcum , has a redder hue than pure but mundane gold. Orichalcum seems to catch and hold light in its translucent depth, giving it a warm, fiery glow. Similar to mundane gold, orichalcum can be drawn into incredibly fine wires and beaten into leaf. Even the fiercest mundane acid cannot dissolve orichalcum. </div><div>Lunargent, or perfected silver, is likewise translucent and holds a cool, slightly blue glow. Lunargent, too, is highly malleable and chemically inert. </div><div>Perfected mercury, or hermium,  combines great density with a glittering silver gleam and perfect fluidity. In fact, hermium has the same \u201csuperfluid\u201d properties as liquid helium: hermium can creep over the rim of a vessel to collect in a lower vessel,  stir hermium and the current circles forever. Hermium flows through the smallest opening with no friction at all. </div><div>Perfected copper, tin and lead are considerably less well-known to mages and have fewer known uses. The Forge Masters, however, esteem siderite  \u2014 perfected iron \u2014 above all other metals. Siderite is the strongest, toughest metal of all. It can bend like rubber and spring back into shape without the slightest trace of metal fatigue. Siderite holds an edge that never dulls. It cuts diamond and the finest mundane steel. Siderite doesn\u2019t look special, though; its gray gleam may glitter a bit more than ordinary iron or steel, but nothing about it looks magical to the untrained eye. Meteoric iron is half-perfected already: it takes just one dozen passes through Twilight to become true siderite. </div><div>The perfected metals do not have active magical powers of their own. If a mage enchants an item made of perfected metal, however, his player receives a +1 equipment bonus to all the rolls to cast the necessary spells. Each metal has its own mystic affinities, apart from physical properties that make one metal better suited than others for various purposes. The metals do not correspond neatly to particular Arcana or Practices, though: selecting the optimum metals for an item is a matter of intuition rather than charts and formulas. For instance, dull, heavy lead is often associated with Death, but lead\u2019s ancient use as a vehicle for curses gives perfected lead an affinity for Fate as well \u2014 never mind that mages also associate Fate with lunargent, the metal of the Acanthus Watchtower. The strength of siderite, however, makes it the best perfected metal for weapons, no matter what spells the weapon bears. </div><div>Forge Masters also alloy the perfected metals. Some of these do  have intrinsic magical powers of their own; thaumium is the best-known example. The Atlanteans knew dozens of perfected alloys. Modern mages know only a few. The Forge Masters study Atlantean artifacts in hopes of reconstructing the \u201ctrade secrets\u201d of forgotten alloys. Each alloy requires its own spell of Matter and Prime to forge, however \u2014 analogous to \u201cForge Thaumium\u201d (see Mage: The Awakening , p. 203).</div> <h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2> <div>As a Legacy, the Forge Masters set no formal requirements a recruit must meet, beyond the necessary competence at metalwork and the Arcana of Matter and Prime. Each master decides on his own whether to accept an apprentice, and helps shape his student\u2019s soul when the master thinks the student is ready. No Forge Master has the authority to question another Forge Master\u2019s judgment in this respect. </div><div>In practice, Powersmiths usually demand at least a year of apprenticeship before inducting a mage into the Legacy. Helping an apprentice to craft his soul is quite a drastic expenditure on a Forge Master\u2019s part, comparable to forging an imbued item. They do not expend their own soul\u2019s force lightly. A year of hard work pays the tutor in advance, and makes sure the prospective Powersmith really, truly wants to devote his life to  the Legacy. It also gives the tutor and pupil a chance to discover any personality conflicts before what may be a lifetime\u2019s work together. </div><div>Initiating a new Forge Master is the Legacy\u2019s most elaborate ritual. The tutor builds a special furnace of stone and clay, using no magic whatsoever and no tools he did not forge himself. A hollow in the furnace floor holds a cup of the tutor\u2019s own blood and as much tass as he can collect. </div><div>The apprentice climbs into the furnace. He carries a nail of siderite. The tutor fires the furnace with Mana, using the spells \u201cCelestial Flame\u201d and \u201cChannel Mana\u201d (see Mage: The Awakening , p. 224), and seals the apprentice inside. The spell-fire is modulated to cause pain but not serious damage. The apprentice drives the siderite nail through one wrist and lets his blood fall into the spell-fire to mingle with his tutor\u2019s blood. Then he meditates as his tutor channels the spell-fire into his body and soul, until the pupil absorbs all the Mana he can, charged with the resonance of blood, iron and fire. </div><div>The tutor breaks open the furnace. The pupil steps forth, glowing with spell-fire, and the Forge Master strikes the pupil with a phantasmal hammer of Mana imbued with the pupil\u2019s own soul-pattern. The Powersmith literally hammers his apprentice\u2019s soul into a new form. At the end, the pupil leaps into a waiting bath of cold water and lets the Mana flood out of him in a rush. Thus does he temper his own soul and lock it into the Legacy\u2019s pattern. When he emerges, the siderite nail is gone \u2014 consumed along with the tass. The tutor destroys the furnace and may even disintegrate its stones, so it shall never be used for any purpose less sacred. </div><div>The second Attainment involves a similar rite. This time, however, the pupil stabs his other wrist with a nail of thaumium. The third Attainment involves a third sojourn in the furnace, but the Forge Master stabs his own side with a blade of electrum magicum , the alloy of all seven perfected metals. </div><div>The initiation of a new Forge Master is a big event in the Legacy. Since an initiation is usually scheduled months in advance, other Powersmiths have plenty of time to learn about the ceremony. Even if the tutor doesn\u2019t belong to a guild, several other Forge Masters probably attend to watch and toast the new Powersmith.</div> <h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Enchantments of the Forge</h3> <div>Forge Masters know as wide a range of magic as any other mage, but crafting magic items is their reason for existence. They have few rivals in this demanding art. Over the millennia, Forge Masters gave the orders several rotes to imbue magic items or to assist in the enchantment process. These rotes are now considered Free Council rotes, though the Atlantean orders may know them, too. </div><div>Creating a magic item is a big event among Forge Masters. They don\u2019t do it as often as they\u2019d like because of the high personal cost (represented by the sacrifice of a dot of Willpower). Once upon a time, they believe, Powersmiths could imbue their works with magic purely through their craft and their Attainments. Now, however, a mage must place part of his Awakened soul in an item to preserve its magic. One consequence is that Forge Masters seldom waste their craft on small enchantments: they forge the most powerful and wonderful item they can. They also charge correspondingly high prices for their work, in rotes, favors and perfected metals as well as cash. </div><div>The forging of a wonder is a sufficiently rare and valued feat that any Powersmith who hears about it probably shows up to watch, kibitz and try to pick up a magical trade secret or two. Apart from Attainments, crafting magic items is the key to prestige in the Legacy. For all the rough humor among Forge Masters, they feel great respect for colleagues who have imbued metal with powerful and innovative enchantments.</div>",attainmentsDescrizione:"<div>The Attainments of the Forge Masters strengthen the metaphysical imbuement of purpose that distinguishes a tool from unshaped matter. At first, a Powersmith can work only a slight augmentation to make a tool or weapon subtly better at fulfilling its purpose, whatever that may be. Later, the Forge Master can strengthen this subtle power enough that an item can affect incorporeal entities. The greatest Powersmiths live up to their nickname by creating magic items from primal energy itself. </div><div>A Forge Master could perform all these feats through force of will, but he would wrench reality by doing so. The subtle magic of this Legacy, however, builds on the basic fact that a skilled artisan can improve whatever he works upon. To use each Attainment, a Forge Master must spend at least a turn testing, maintaining or otherwise fiddling with the item he wants to enchant. The character can obtain longer-lasting  results by a full scene of mundane-seeming work on the item. For example, a Forge Master might sharpen a blade or tune a pickup truck\u2019s engine. </div><div>These Attainments work best on items principally made of metal, since that is the Legacy\u2019s focus. Nevertheless, a Forge Master can use his Attainments on tools and weapons of other materials. Instead of a day, however, the effects last only one scene after the mage finishes his work, and he must expend one Mana (on top of any other cost). In any case, these Attainments cannot affect anything with a Size greater than 15. Any larger target requires actual spellcasting, with all the risks that entails.</div>",firstAttainmentName:"The Master\u2019s Hand",firstAttainmentPrerequisites:"Gnosis 3, Prime 2, Matter 2, Craft 3",firstAttainmentDescription:"<div>The knowing hand of a master craftsman can work away slight imperfections in a tool, improving its performance. A knife becomes sharper, a gun better balanced, a car handles better; even a hairpin can become a better lockpick, or a metal flute gains a sweeter tone. Whatever the Forge Master works upon gains the \u201c9 again\u201d quality, as if he had used the Matter 2 \u201cAlter Accuracy\u201d spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 196). The mage\u2019s Prime dots determine the maximum number of rolls within the next day for which the item can gain this effect.</div><div>The improvement to function becomes most obvious, perhaps, with weapons. Any task gains a greater chance of success, however, if performed with tools improved by The Master\u2019s Hand. For instance, a car given a magical tuneup performs better in a chase or other challenging conditions (\u201c9 again\u201d on Dexterity + Drive), improvised tools let an amateur pick locks like an experienced burglar (Dexterity + Larceny) and a musician gives a better performance on the cleaned and slightly modified flute (Manipulation + Expression). Obviously, any repair attempt becomes more likely to succeed using augmented tools, so a sensible Powersmith carefully burnishes and tests his tools before important mechanical tasks.</div><div>In addition, a Forge Master automatically sees the enchantments on enhanced items, imbued items and artifacts, as if he used the Prime 1 \u201cAnalyze Enchanted Item\u201d spell (see Mage: The Awakening , pp. 219\u2013220), but rolling Intelligence + Occult + Prime. That a made object bears enchantment is as obvious as its color; analyzing the enchantment still requires the dice roll. This mystical sense does not detect magic not associated with objects shaped by intelligence; for example, this sense won\u2019t register an active Hallow. To sense other magical auras, a Forge Master needs to use normal spells or rotes.</div>",firstAttainmentOptArcana:"",firstAttainmentOptDescrizione:"",secondAttainmentName:"Primal Tempering",secondAttainmentPrerequisites:"Gnosis 5, Prime 3, Craft 4",secondAttainmentDescription:"<div>As a Powersmith gains in mastery, he can strengthen the power of will and purpose in any man-made object to make it realer than real: it becomes metaphysically potent enough to affect Twilight and Shadow entities such as ghosts and spirits. This acts like the Prime 3 \u201cEphemeral Enchantment\u201d spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 225), except no roll is required. The  mage\u2019s dots in Prime serve as the number of successes. Primal Tempering lasts a scene if performed as an instant action, or a full day if the Forge Master works on the object for a full scene. Only one object receives the subtle enchantment, so if a Forge Master wanted to enchant extra ammunition for a gun, he would need to spend an additional scene or action using Primal Tempering on each magazine. A suit of armor counts as one entity because one person wears the various pieces, but a suit of armor and a shield would nevertheless require separate enchantments.</div><div>A Forge Master with Prime 5 can endow an object with the power to inflict aggravated damage. This still requires a user who can supply the item with Mana, however, or the Powersmith can grant the item its own Mana reserve.</div><div>The metaphysical density given by Primal Tempering extends to more than attack and defense. The object becomes as real and solid to incorporeal entities as it is in the material world. Not only does Primally Tempered armor blocks a spirit\u2019s attacks, but an entity in Twilight could push the keys of a Primally Tempered typewriter to type a message, or the entity might find a Primally Tempered steel box as hard to escape as a mortal would. The Storyteller should judge such cases based on the purpose  of the object: a spirit could type on the typewriter but not pick it up to batter a material foe, because a typewriter exists to write, not to be used as a bludgeon \u2014 and that reason for existence is what Primal Tempering strengthens so it extends into spiritual realms.</div><div> This Attainment also grants a small benefit to the \u201cImbue Item\u201d spell or \u201cForge of Power\u201d rote (see Mage: The Awakening , pp. 225\u2013226), though the Attainment\u2019s benefit does not substitute for the rote or spell. For a Forge Master with this Attainment, enchanting a magic item always counts as covert magic, even if the spells stored in the item are vulgar. Using  the item can still cause Paradoxes.</div>",secondAttainmentOptArcana:"Matter 3",secondAttainmentOptDescrizione:"While granting an object Primal Tempering, a Forge Master with Matter 3 can also increase the object\u2019s Durability by as many points as his rank in Matter, much as if he used Alter Integrity (see Mage: The Awakening , p. 198).

He has so internalized the power of toolmaking that he can conjure weapons, armor or simple mechanical devices from pure Mana or tass. A Powersmith cannot conjure a device with its own power source (no automobiles or electric drills), and nothing much more complicated than a push-lawnmower or combination lock. The mage\u2019s rating in Prime acts as the relevant factors for whatever the Forge Master creates. An item that lasts only a scene takes a turn to conjure; if the Powersmith spends a full scene, he can create an item that lasts a full day, and, in addition, give the item Primal Tempering  or imbue it with spells. Any spells cast into the conjured item still count toward the mage\u2019s normal number of spells in use.

The epic of Gilgamesh and Homer\u2019s tales are the Skalds\u2019 forerunners or, some believe, their legacies. Their tales describe the heroes of ancient legend and the falls of kings.

There are always a few mages who think the Legacy\u2019s members are wasting their time on memorization, or that they spend too much effort on the past or that they are just plain fruity, but these detractors are in the minority. The sheer usefulness of  the Skalds\u2019 traditions cannot be denied, and their dedication earns them a great deal of respect. <div>Members of the Mysterium consider Lore-singers great resources.

Finally, a Skald often has a musical instrument of some kind, even something as simple as a recorder or a harmonica, though most favor musical tools that allow them to sing simultaneously.",background:" Mages who choose to become Skalds typically have some prior affinity for the arts. Some come into the Legacy with strong backgrounds in music and poetry; others build on their fond study of history or cultural literature o f all kinds. More than a few combine all these. Teaching is a common profession and passion among the Skalds. Poetry and music aren\u2019t the only arts they favor. Many also paint, sculpt or just about anything creative \u2014 though they skew away from the more postmodern interpretations of \u201cart.\u201d",organizzation:"<div>Skalds are only loosely tied to one another. One has very little influence over another, even with greater mastery over the Legacy\u2019s Attainments. It is in their nature to be respectful of their elders, who can teach them, but respect is not obeisance. Each Skald is busy soaking up the zeitgeist of his time, composing the sonnets and epics that acclaim or curse rulers or heroes of the day. The Skald remembers, recites and records. There\u2019s no reason for an elder Skald to give his students orders, because they do not perform missions or have concrete tasks. Their only mission is to watch, to absorb the ambiance and from it to create. </div><div>Perhaps because Skalds do not feel obligated to one another, they communicate freely and often. Tutors and their apprentices know each other best and talk the most, but they are not secretive with contacts among the Legacy. If anything, Skalds are more open with each other than most mages. It isn\u2019t hard for one Skald to meet another in a far-away Consilium, even through a connection as vague as a twice-removed \u201ccousin\u201d in the Legacy. Communicating allows the Skalds to share poems and songs that they discover and create, and they do so eagerly. </div><div>There is usually only one Skald in a given Consilium, as the Skalds reason that it is better not to serve a region with too much recitation and song. More of them occasionally come together for training or for competition. When a mage is just joining the Legacy, he goes where his tutor goes. The apprentice studies under her, learning the Legacy\u2019s memorization tricks and ancient poetic tradition. After the student has learned enough about being a Skald to do the duty and not embarrass his tutor, she cuts him loose. He may stay around or he may find his own place, but he\u2019s not going to have someone watching out for him anymore \u2014 even when the student and tutor remain on good terms. </div><div>Skalds sometimes come together for friendly (or unfriendly) competitions. Such events are much more occasions for several Skalds to share their compositions and spread their communal knowledge than real competitions. Depending on who attends, these can resemble poetry readings (or, less often, slams), historical debates, art exhibitions, mini-Woodstocks or combinations of them all. Even in friendly company, Skalds are generally proud of their skill at melody or oratory, and they really do try to out-perform one another. It\u2019s a matter of honor and renown. </div><div>Rivalries do exist between Skalds, and one might challenge another out of ambition instead of friendly competition. There\u2019s usually little more than recognition riding on the result, but two Skalds might agree that the victor in such a contest wins the right to serve a particular region or Consilium as the \u201cofficial\u201d or \u201cforemost\u201d Skald and chronicler. There\u2019s no stigma attached to challenges, at least not among members of the Legacy. They understand that the region wouldn\u2019t be under contention unless it were interesting and influential, and an area worth fighting over should have the best Lore-singer available. </div><div>Not all Skalds settle down in one area or Consilium. Some feel they best serve their calling by traveling, seeing the places that aren\u2019t frequented by others and being the flies on the wall in those places. Traveling Lore-singers pass through Consilii with \u201cresident\u201d Skalds every few weeks or months, depending on their habits. When one does, it is common practice to introduce herself to the member of her Legacy first. He then introduces the traveler to the Consilium, lessening the suspicion common about unknown mages. The foreign Skald has the opportunity to play for the Consilium, the local Loresinger gets to hear where the traveler\u2019s been and play for her in turn and the Consilium gets a show. The local Skald\u2019s only responsibility is to vouch for the traveler, not to house her; she must earn her keep on her own, generally by bringing news and song to the Consilium.</div>",suggestedOblations:"Spending an hour memorizing an ancient epic, saga or song, or acquainting oneself with a variant telling or translation of one already known.

A Skald with the first Attainment has the ability to read the tenor of an audience. This effect is similar to the Mind 1 \u201cAura Perception\u201d spell, except that Soothe the Beast reveals the general emotional condition of a crowd, rather than individual auras, although intense individual emotions might still be noticeable.</div><div>By playing a song or reciting a poem or story for at least a minute, the Skald can project a certain emotion into the minds of those who hear it.

In some way, he must communicate to the intended target and to those around her the failings and flaws they should see. At the Attainment\u2019s shortest, this is an instant action based around a short couplet. Used with longer forms of art, the action takes place several times throughout the performance.

She must either flee the scrutiny of her peers (nearly always diminishing her in their eyes) or admit her faults and submit herself to their judgments. </div><div>A Skald can use this Attainment on a single target once per dot of his own Intelligence per scene. If the scene ends without  bringing the target to zero, the target regains any Willpower lost to this effect.

She must also craft the performance to a specific entity; the performance cannot affect \u201cthe nearest spirit\u201d or \u201ca tree spirit\u201d unless she knows specifically which spirit that is \u2014 usually by first observing it. </div><div>This Attainment resembles the Spirit 3 \u201cControl Spirit\u201d spell. By performing for at least one minute per Rank of the target spirit, the Skald may command that spirit with a Presence + Expression + Spirit roll, contested by the spirit\u2019s Resistance. One potent benefit of this Attainment is that the spirit generally does not feel put-upon. The skill and meaning of the Skald\u2019s performance makes the spirit want  to perform the set tasks. When the effect\u2019s duration ends, the spirit returns to its old habits, but it does not feel anger at being compelled. The spirit was moved by the poetry, not by the mage\u2019s will. </div><div>This does not necessarily appear as magic to those who watch the Skald use it. To onlookers, the performance appears to be particularly poignant and meaningful. Some connect it to the subsequent movement of the earth or strike of lightning. Only those with some understanding of Spirit recognize the spiritual influence that leads the words or music, and often only another Skald can decipher exactly what commands the performance contains. </div><div>Lore-singers generally use this Attainment not to use spirits as spies or servants, but to utilize the spirits\u2019 particular Influences. One tune calms the storm-spirit and thus calms the storm; a well-worded sonnet causes an earthquake that slows a region\u2019s invaders.

With  Mind 5, this Attainment can have prolonged Duration, just as the spell, and the Skald may affect additional targets for the typical dice penalties. Commanding people in this way is not obvious. Observers perceive the singing or the poetry, and then the target of the Attainment acts. Even Mage Sight does not reveal the influence of Hearing the Kind Piper.  </div><div>That the Skalds wield secret, effective mind control frightens many. For this reason, the Skalds apply a very public code of ethics to the use of this Attainment. Wherever mages know of the Legacy and its Attainments, they also know that the Skalds are dedicated to using this influence only  in pursuit of bettering individuals and societies. The Skalds use this control to expose the corrupt and reveal bashful heroes. On the individual level, the Skalds might help a person quit an addiction or not murder in a fit of passion, but even these are skirting the edge.

Is it the capacity to Awaken? Such a view is arrogant in the extreme, say the Sphinxes, for to look at the Sleepers as inferior is to ignore one\u2019s own humanity. No, to the mages who choose to follow this Legacy, the true magic of humanity is language. More to the point, it is the capacity for symbolic recognition, to see a gesture or a marking, hear a collection of sounds, and from that understand. Human beings are optimized, either by the design of a greater being or the rigors of evolution, toward speech and language, both anatomically and neurologically. But all of the biophysical adaptations of the human body toward speech mean nothing without the ability to understand symbols. Upon this phenomenon (some would say \u201cmiracle\u201d), the Legacy of the Sphinx is based.</div><div>Walking the path of the Sphinx is an exercise in abstraction, for the Legacy teaches understanding without processing, learning truth without realizing fact. A Sphinx sees meaning everywhere \u2014 in the number of cracks in a sidewalk, in the seemingly random sounds from a baby\u2019s babbling, in the texture of a brick wall. Intrinsic in this ability to find meaning anywhere is the knowledge that this meaning comes from somewhere. Sphinxes who cleave to the Atlantean model of mystical understanding posit that this meaning might come from ancient masters sending information forward in time, in a much more subtle way than with the ananke (see p. 330 of Mage: The Awakening). Those who do not follow the orders of the Pentacle \u2014 and even some who do \u2014 believe that this truth comes directly from the Supernal Realms.</div><div>The name \u201cSphinx,\u201d of course, comes from the mythological creature that Oedipus confronted near Thebes.

Indeed, they tend to view themselves as searchers trying to solve a riddle. That riddle is difficult to express, because it is so vast in scope, but the basic idea is this: If meaning can be found in anything, at any level of understanding or consciousness, then what is the ultimate meaning? Where does the truth come from, and to what purpose?</div>",alternateNickname:"Pathfinders",orders:"While any Mastigos can become a Sphinx, the Legacy\u2019s membership is primarily drawn from the Mysterium. The order\u2019s predilection for finding, analyzing and cataloguing knowledge, combined with the fact that the Mysterium often encounters information too dangerous to be read and understood by an untrained mage, points members of all Paths toward the Legacy. Outside of the Mysterium, the order that claims the largest number of Pathfinders is unquestionably the Guardians of the Veil. Sphinxes are by nature superlative ciphers, capable of breaking almost any code or circumventing any puzzle, given enough time. The Guardians thus appreciate their ability to weave symbols and hidden messages, both true and misleading, into the secret societies and fronts that the order sets up. In fact, it isn\u2019t uncommon for an Epopt to be a Sphinx herself or at least work with one. It\u2019s easy for even the Guardians themselves to become lost in the morass of conflicting symbolism and double-blind codes, and a Sphinx makes a good \u201cskeleton key\u201d when quick understanding and interpretation are necessary.<div>Warlocks of other orders do find their way to the Legacy as well, of course. Sphinxes of the Adamantine Arrow tend to use their ability to find meaning and truth in the mundane as a way to avoid danger and protect those around them. Pathfinders in the Free Council stay on the cutting edge of linguistic theory and language development, searching for ways to expand people\u2019s understanding of each other and themselves.

The greatest secrets of the Supernal Realms were fractured, shards of power and knowledge spread out among the mages of the world. Without the Island of the Magi\u2019s society to compile the knowledge, the Awakened had to work alone or in small cabals, never knowing enough of the truth to recapture their past glories.</div><div>The Sphinx Legacy arose from the frustration of those mages. The Mastigos of the time knew that with the application of the Mind Arcanum they could comprehend any earthly language, but that wasn\u2019t enough. Language wasn\u2019t the true barrier, these mages discovered, because a language is merely a set of symbols. These primordial Sphinxes realized that inherent in the process of making symbols lay the solution to the confusion caused by the destruction of the Celestial Ladder \u2014 that they could look beyond graphemes and sounds and simply communicate with pure meaning.</div><div>Modern-day Sphinxes sometimes claim that the Legacy was an important part of the formation of the Mysterium, and that might well be true. Whether or not this was the case, the Sphinx Legacy became, over time, the province of the Wings of the Dragon almost exclusively. While a lone Mastigos might occasionally discover and follow the Legacy, the order guarded its secrets jealously. Something as basic to humanity as the quest for communication and language, however, wasn\u2019t going to remain under lock and key forever.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The De Velasco Resurgence</h3><div>The first reliably recorded instance of a mage outside the Mysterium joining the Legacy came in 1575 or so, in a book written by a Spanish nobleman (and Mastigos) named Juan de Velasco. De Velasco had observed his two young cousins, who were both born deaf, being tutored by a Benedictine monk named Pedro Ponce de L\xe9on. Classical opinions on the deaf stated that they had very little education potential and that they could never learn to speak (if deafness occurred pre-lingually). Ponce de L\xe9on, himself a Sleeper, challenged that opinion, and taught the de Velasco brothers not only to read and write, but to speak three different languages. He did not, however, record his methods, and so history would have to wait for widespread methods of educating the deaf, but Juan de Velasco watched his cousins\u2019 lessons with interest. He was less interested in teaching deaf people than in the conveyance of meaning in non-verbal ways. He wrote several treatises on the topic for his Consilium, the most famous of which was titled \u201cThe Art and Science of the Recognition of Meaning.\u201d In that document, he detailed how he was able to send coded messages through paintings and divine the immediate future by listening to hymns at Mass (as later mages have pointed out, de Velasco probably wasn\u2019t reading the future per se; rather, he was reading probability).</div><div>De Velasco\u2019s writings have been translated into many different languages over the years, although modern Sphinxes have found that reading them in their original Latin yields layers of meaning far beyond the simple message of the words. The Mysterium currently holds most of these documents, but de Velasco was a prolific writer and painter, and historians the world over might unknowingly hold either one of his esoteric writings or hauntingly beautiful paintings. Either type of work might actually be a road map to a rote, an Atlantean temple or some other worthy goal. </div><div>De Velasco left no record behind of a pupil, but it is widely accepted that de Velasco passed his learning along to another Mastigos. Whether this pupil was a member of the Mysterium or not is a debated issue; the order claims that he was, while members of all of the other orders also claim him (and often have records that seem to support their claims). The Mysterium has history on its side, of course, but after de Velasco the Legacy became available to any mage of the order who wished to become a Pathfinder. Since then, the Mysterium has tried to project the image that they created the Legacy in the first place. Even so, the Legacy remains the province of the Warlocks just as much as that of the Alae Draconis.</div><div>Other than de Velasco, history has not produced famous Sphinxes. The Pathfinders tend to be inscrutable and unobtrusive, even by Awakened standards, and, of course, any mage who achieved mastery of the Legacy\u2019s Attainments would be exceptionally difficult to find in any record (see the Off the Path Attainment, below). The Mysterium, true to form, tries to keep records of the members of the order who have gone on to become Pathfinders, but the Sphinxes themselves often alter such records, leaving behind only obtuse riddles that, properly interpreted, might lead to the mage in question.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2></div><div>Because so much of the Sphinx mindset and activity relies on observation rather than direct action, mages outside of the Mysterium don\u2019t often know much about the Legacy. What they do know tends to depend on who they hear it from or the particular Sphinx they\u2019ve encountered. Some Sphinxes are infuriatingly cryptic, either because they genuinely enjoy lording their uncanny insight over others or because they are inundated with so much information that they fear to reveal too much or too little. Other Sphinxes are happy to share what they know, but are well aware that their information tends to be true, but lacking in context. Consider: A Sphinx can read a thick book in an ancient language in an hour and understand all of the information it contains, but he will be hard-pressed to convey the nuances and intricacies of the information. His rendition of the information resembles a quick summary, and this leaves listeners to wonder about its accuracy. Indeed, it\u2019s not uncommon for non-Sphinxes to assume that a Pathfinder is using some kind of fortune-telling method to glean the information, and such methods (often based on Time or Space magic) aren\u2019t often completely accurate. The Sphinxes protest this, saying that their methods rely on direct observation rather than symbolic guesswork, but because those methods are based largely on intuition that non-Sphinxes do not possess these protests often go unheard. In the end, many Pathfinders find it easiest not to advertise their membership in the Legacy and to offer help and advice only when it is requested. Of course, that sometimes results in other mages labeling them reclusive and unhelpful, but an experienced Pathfinder has long since given up on pleasing all the people all the time.</div><div>The culture of the Sphinx Legacy is one of research, academia and intuition. Sphinxes aren\u2019t necessarily impulsive, but they do tend to be easily distracted, and mentors of the Legacy encourage Pathfinders to follow clues that they see in the hidden patterns of the world. This leads Sphinxes to cross paths with cabals of mages and even stranger inhabitants of the World of Darkness, and so members of the Legacy tend to be skilled at either diplomacy or flight (or, more rarely, defensive combat). Among the Awakened, Sphinxes try to become well-versed in which cabal holds influence in what area and who the local movers and shakers of the Consilium are, just in case the Sphinxes need to name-drop to justify trespassing. Their skill in dealing with people grants them a great deal of latitude in such situations, and so Sphinxes often occupy positions in a Consilium such as Herald or Councilor.</div><div>In the Mysterium, the Sphinx takes up the role of guardian, much like his namesake. Sphinxes don\u2019t ask riddles of seekers, but they also don\u2019t give information out to just anyone. This isn\u2019t due to a perception that others aren\u2019t worthy of the knowledge (usually), but rather that the knowledge in question might be dangerous. Sphinxes can absorb information without attracting its attention, learning by observation of patterns rather than direct reading and study. As such, a Sphinx might administer a coded test to a mage seeking a book or fact that the Sphinx considers risky. If the mage has the patience and skill to decipher it, the Sphinx considers it safe to grant the mage what he seeks. This role, of course, is the very definition of a thankless task, since it brands the Sphinx as a stingy distributor of knowledge. Even so, it is a role for which the Pathfinders are uniquely suited, and so members of the Legacy who belong to the Mysterium often become Censors.</div><div>The Legacy\u2019s overarching philosophy \u2014 that the universe has meaning and that this meaning was put in place deliberately \u2014 doesn\u2019t actually see much discussion among Sphinxes unless one of them has made a breakthrough. New members of the Legacy often hear the theory on the matter that their tutors espouse, and pick up more as they interact with other Pathfinders. Most Sphinxes have preconceived notions about the nature of the meaning of the universe. Popular hypotheses include the following:</div><ul><li><strong>God:</strong> Regardless of what religion or faith the Sphinx espouses, the notion of a Divine creator (or at least organizer) is almost as popular among mages as among Sleepers. The fact that no explanation of Atlantis, the Fall, the Celestial Ladder, or the Supernal Realms actually contradicts this belief is helpful. Theist Sphinxes believe that the messages they see in everyday patterns are God\u2019s communication with Earth, and that the language of pure meaning is the true divine language.</li><li><strong>Oracles:</strong> Sphinxes with a more magic-centered view of the world believe that the Oracles, the secret masters trapped in the Supernal Realms during the collapse of the Celestial Ladder, manipulate events and patterns so subtly that these machinations are virtually unnoticeable unless one is specifically looking. These Sphinxes claim that, with rare exceptions (such as the ananke), the Oracles cannot communicate directly, as the Abyss thwarts them. Only by nudging the world in imperceptible ways \u2014 causing a flock of birds to take flight at the right second, a gust of wind that alters the direction of raindrops, and so on \u2014 can they send their messages. Of course, if the Oracles can do this, the Sphinxes sometimes wonder, what stops the Exarchs from doing so as well? The answer is: nothing, and the Seers of the Throne boast their share of Pathfinders.</li><li><strong>The Supernal Realms:</strong> Although the Sphinx Legacy belongs as much to the Warlocks as to the Mysterium, comparatively few Mastigos espouse this particular theory to explain the origin of the messages in the world. Those who do are quite different from the usual contemplative and observant Pathfinders \u2014 such Mastigos tend to be fearful and paranoid. Some Sphinxes believe that the denizens of the Supernal Realms are responsible for the informative patterns that the Sphinxes so diligently analyze. These denizens might not even be creating these patterns deliberately, the mages say, but the Fallen World reflects the Supernal Realms. Therefore, the true nature of reality comes through in everything the world has to offer, regardless of whether Sleepers (or even most of the Awakened) are prepared to look for it. Of course, the implications of the inhabitants of Pandemonium leaving hints for mages to find are troubling, to say the least. This, perhaps, is why this theory has more adherents among Mysterium Sphinxes of other Paths. The notion that the patterns are the inhuman whispers of demons is profoundly disquieting. No matter which Supernal Realm the patterns originate from, though (and it would make more sense to assume that all of them have some input), their natives are inscrutable and largely unknowable by human standards, yet certainly not all-powerful. Is there a greater design above even the mysterious clues left in random patterns of wind, ink, and brick?</li></ul><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Prospective Sphinxes often begin their training for the Legacy before they know it exists. Inquisitive and persistent, they pay close attention to the world around them, searching for an overlying meaning. Chaos theory, fractal theory and even the \u201ctheory\u201d of intelligent design have produced students of the right mindset to become Pathfinders. If a mage looks deeply enough into the right patterns, using the right methods, he might receive a flash of insight that allows him to break a message coded with the Hidden Meaning Attainment. Alternately, his studies might just lead him to a mage already known for the same kind of research. In any case, sooner or later the prospective Sphinx finds a Sphinx.</div><div>Presuming that the Sphinx that the prospective member finds is willing and able to take on a pupil, and that the chemistry between the two mages is of the right sort to permit such a relationship, the tutor typically inundates the student with coded messages. At first, the mage simply uses mundane codes, starting with simple alphabetical ciphers and moving up to complex encryption. The mage doesn\u2019t need to learn how to break all of these codes, and certainly isn\u2019t forbidden from using magic in his attempt. The important lesson here is to look beyond letters, numbers and words and see meaning in markings, sounds and patterns. This kind of approach isn\u2019t easy to teach, as it relies more on intuition than process, and some mages simply aren\u2019t up to the task. The tutor watches carefully to see if his student is capable of learning what the tutor is presenting, of seeing a meaning greater than the message. If so, they can begin the process of soulcrafting. If not, the tutor gently (or not-so-gently, depending on the mage in question) suggests that the student might find what he seeks elsewhere. In the Mysterium, the process works a little differently. Mages who show a predilection for puzzles, ciphers and language are often told about the Legacy in a roundabout fashion (so as to avoid making it seem as though membership in a Legacy is being offered or suggested).</div><div>A mage who is a good candidate for becoming a Pathfinder will pursue information about the Legacy, or so goes the theory. Once word gets out in a given Consilium\u2019s Mysterium cabal(s) that a mage wants to join the Legacy, the network becomes activated and the mage\u2019s accomplishments, history, faults and foibles are made known to any Sphinx who bothers to check. If the mage is a good fit for the Legacy, a tutor arranges to travel to the student or have the student brought to him for training. In either case, the stages of soulcrafting don\u2019t require much in the way of ceremony. Once a mage has reached the required level of power, his tutor assists him in delving deeper into the mysteries of the world\u2019s wisdom. This is normally accompanied by several days of study, questioning and observation of whatever phenomena the mentor feels hold the wisdom the student needs in order to progress. Some tutors hole their students up in libraries preceding a new Attainment, others immerse their charges in as much sensation as possible in order to force the student to focus on one pattern at a time.</div><div>Tutors, whatever their methods, watch their students for signs of madness at all times. When everything around a mage is significant, when nothing is coincidence or meaningless, he can feel paralyzed and helpless, afraid to do anything for fear of offsetting some cosmic balance. Alternately, some Sphinxes become drunk with the power and knowledge they possess, striving to learn as much as they can to exert maximum possible influence in the world. Either of these eventualities is cause for alarm to the tutor, because they distract the student from his quest to learn the origin of meaning. A Sphinx who degenerates too much or too quickly in Wisdom might find himself placed in an oubliette, magically deprived of any sensation whatsoever. It is believed that, in this kind of environment with no patterns from which to derive information, that a mad Sphinx can find himself again and regain his sanity. This doesn\u2019t always work, of course; sometimes the madness just intensifies, but the oubliette is the best the Legacy can do to help. The alternative is to remove the mage\u2019s ability to see the world\u2019s meaning permanently, and the only way to do that is to kill him.</div>",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"The Attainments of the Sphinx are, for the most part, perceptive in nature rather than proactive. To the Pathfinders, the important and most difficult part of problem-solving is gaining the knowledge required to solve it. Alexander\u2019s brutish solution to the Gordian Knot repulses them, because it sends the message that brute force can replace patience and understanding. Destructive magic can be countered, manipulative magic can be redirected, but magic that hides knowledge cannot stop a persistent and intelligent willworker.",firstAttainmentName:"Hidden Meaning",firstAttainmentPrerequisites:"Gnosis 3, Fate 2, Investigation 2",firstAttainmentDescription:"<div>The Sphinx\u2019s first Attainment allows her to find and decipher wisdom in the mundane. Anything that has a pattern can be used for this purpose, be it cracks in the ceiling or the calls of a flock of birds. The mage merely needs to study the pattern for a few seconds to gain the information contained therein. The effect is similar to the Fate 1 \u201cInterconnections\u201d spell (see p. 148 of Mage: The Awakening), except that the Attainment requires only an instant action and bestows information as though the mage had achieved five successes on the roll. Sphinxes, therefore, are awash in information if they stop to consider it, able to see connections, however faint, between any objects, people or places in sight. In addition to see these sympathetic connections, a Sphinx can use this Attainment to solve puzzles and riddles, since she can see the patterns behind their creation. Sphinx characters with this Attainment receive a +3 modifier to all Mental rolls involving riddles, puzzles, mazes or other such conundrums.</div><div>A more common use of this Attainment, however, is its ability to hide meaning within seemingly random patterns. A Sphinx can use Hidden Meaning to write (or draw or record) a message in a code that no Sleeper cipher can crack. The mage must physically create the message, either by writing a seemingly innocuous letter, drawing a picture or any other method she prefers. The player rolls Manipulation + Investigation or Academics to encrypt the message. When another mage with this Attainment tries to decipher the code, her player must make an extended Intelligence + Investigation roll to do so, with a number of required successes equal to [5 x the successes on the encryption roll]. Again, each roll requires an hour of deciphering. The encoding mage may choose to forego her roll, meaning that any Sphinx can decode the message automatically.</div><div>A mage with Fate 2 can also attempt to uncover the meaning in the message. First she must be aware that the underlying meaning exists, which is by itself difficult (she might be tipped off by an ally, a hunch or even the Dream Merit). She then casts an improvised and extended Fate 2 spell, with a number of required successes equal to [5 x encoder\u2019s successes, minimum of five].</div>",firstAttainmentOptArcana:"Mind 2",firstAttainmentOptDescrizione:"<div>A Sphinx who has studied the Arcanum of Mind can use her knowledge of the patterns and intrinsic meaning to aid her in interactions with others. By studying a person\u2019s movements, the subtle messages conveyed by facial expression, body language and breathing and even how others react to him, the Sphinx gains an advantage in dealing with him. This effect is similar to the Mind 2 \u201cFirst Impressions\u201d spell (see p. 208 of Mage: The Awakening). The Sphinx may add her dots in Mind as a dice bonus to the first roll made with a given target.</div><div>Many Pathfinders discover that the first Attainment of the Legacy is all that they require. Indeed, much of the Legacy\u2019s reputation is based upon the knowledge and insight conveyed in Hidden Meaning \u2014 the ability to solve puzzles and escape labyrinths, to see meaning in the mundane. Sphinxes who continue on use this Attainment as a basis upon which later, more powerful magic rests. Those who pursue other agendas, however, use Hidden Meaning to send messages to double agents in other factions (or even orders), to share research with colleagues around the world, right under the noses of their enemies, and to help Sleepers and even other mages solve puzzles that no methods the Fallen World has produced can fathom. Sphinxes who make frequent use of this Attainment to encrypt messages often develop a preferred format for those messages. One Sphinx might design websites dedicated to some inane fandom, while another writes poetry reproduced only in small-circulation periodicals. As long as the message reaches its intended viewer, the Sphinx doesn\u2019t often care how the vehicle for the message is regarded.</div><div>Sometimes, though, a Sphinx creates a vehicle for a message that has resonance and value in its own right. When this happens, the message might gain fame and widespread circulation, inadvertently passing the message along to any mage who knows how to look for it. Some such messages are even rumored to trigger Awakenings, as Sleepers on the verge of enlightenment see the Supernal Realms lurking in an otherwise mundane painting or song.</div>",secondAttainmentName:"Truth Without Knowledge",secondAttainmentPrerequisites:"Gnosis 5, Fate 3, Investigation 3",secondAttainmentDescription:"<div>Knowing the truth of the world by interpreting its many hidden messages is only the first step toward the superlative understanding that the Sphinx hopes one day to reach. Along that way, however, she learns to take advantage of the clues that surround her as to the fundamental nature of reality. To the untrained eye, she looks lucky or simply confident, but to a mage, every action she takes is fraught with significance. The second Attainment that a Sphinx can achieve allows her to mimic the effects of the Fate 2 \u201cExceptional Luck\u201d spell (see p. 151 of Mage: The Awakening). No roll or Mana expenditure is required. The mage simply takes an instant action to study the patterns of meaning around her, in the same way as described for the Hidden Meaning Attainment. The player may then designate a number of rolls equal to the character\u2019s Gnosis rating during the same scene to have the 9 again quality.</div><div>Pathfinders also find that the more they rely on this Attainment, the more resonant their actions become. Mage Sight cast through the Fate Arcanum can easily detect them. Mages attempting to use Fate spells such as \u201cInterconnections\u201d or \u201cThe Sybil\u2019s Sight\u201d receive a +1 dice bonus during any scene in which Sphinx has used this Attainment to gain the 9 again quality.

This mimics the Mind 3 \u201cUniversal Language\u201d spell, save that the mage can only understand rather than express with this Attainment. Also, she can perform research and learning-related extended Mental tasks in half the time they would normally take (that is, if every roll in an extended task would normally take an hour, this time is reduced to 30 minutes).</div><div>The second Attainment of the Sphinx Legacy opens the mage further to the truth of the world and the hidden messages it contains, but still does not address the question of who or what might be sending these messages. Pathfinders at this stage make superb interpreters, translators and researchers (which is one reason the Mysterium teaches this Legacy). More martial Sphinxes enjoy the tactical benefits of this Attainment, but are careful when using it in conflict with other Awakened, as the Sphinxes are wary of coming to the notice of powerful mages by weaving themselves too tightly into the universe\u2019s inner workings. Indeed, the Sphinxes tell stories of members of the Legacy who have become unable to see the world as anything other than an abstract mess of implication and possibility \u2014 unable to perceive light or sound anymore, they function solely through the information this Attainment grants.</div>",thirdAttainmentName:"Off the Path",thirdAttainmentPrerequisites:"Gnosis 7, Fate 4",thirdAttainmentDescription:"<div>The mage learns to \u201cwalk between\u201d the paths of meaning in the world, disappearing from the cycles of destiny. As far as the world and its many layers of hidden messages are concerned, the Sphinx no longer exists (for as long as this Attainment is active). The Sphinx spends a moment in silent meditation, perceiving the threads of fate and stepping between them (this requires three turns of contemplation). After this, the mage\u2019s destiny can remain \u201cinvisible\u201d in this manner for as long as she wishes, but during this time she cannot use the Truth Without Knowledge Attainment to gain the 9 again quality, or cast any spell altering another person\u2019s destiny (this include spells dealing with oaths, such as \u201cAlter Oath,\u201d as well as spells such as \u201cOcclude Destiny\u201d or \u201cDestroy Bindings\u201d). While the Attainment is active, however, she is immune to all spells that would perceive, alter, improve or denigrate her fate (including the spells just mentioned). All sympathetic magic targeted against her is considered to be four steps further removed.(So, to even attempt targeting her with a sympathetic spell, the caster would need an Intimate connection, which would then suffer a \u201310 penalty as though it were Described.) Also, the Sphinx is extremely difficult to scrutinize magically. She is considered to have the Occultation Merit at a rating equal to her dots in the Fate Arcanum.</div><div>This Attainment does not make the character physically invisible, but does make her easy to ignore.

At this advanced stage, however, a tic of the eye or a shift of the hand betrays everything about the target \u2014 his hopes, his fears and even his memories. This effect is much like the Mind 4 \u201cRead the Depths\u201d spell (see p. 215 of Mage: The Awakening). The mage must spend at least one turn studying the target before using this Attainment. After that, the player rolls Intelligence + Academics \u2013 the subject\u2019s Composure. Unlike Read the Depths, mages with the Mind Arcanum do not get a chance to detect the Attainment\u2019s effect, since it is based entirely on external observation rather than telepathic intrusion. Modifiers for distant memories might apply, but memories or experiences that significantly contributed to the target\u2019s development (such as child abuse or the death of an important figure) might actually grant bonuses, even if the target has repressed them.</div><div>The third Attainment of the Legacy allows the Sphinx to exert some influence over the world\u2019s meanings. Very few Sphinxes progress to this point, because most of them focus more on discovering what being or phenomenon is responsible for the meaning of the world.

The first Thread Cutters didn\u2019t know their names, but knew their natures. Before recorded history, the Legacy\u2019s progenitors huddled in the hinterlands beyond the ruins of Atlantis, contemplating the doom of their kind. With Supernal senses, they saw the wreckage of the heavens and newly distant constellations of occult power.</div><div>This was not as it should have been. How did prophecies fail a nation of oracles? Awakened refugees searched for the answer. They found it when they found the Three. They learned that their homeland\u2019s fall was overdue. Thread Cutters learned to measure the proper span of lives, master the calculus of punishment and bring about the end of men, women, ideas and kingdoms. Thread Cutters believe that all things have an appointed purpose and ending time. Should any being twist that purpose or defy that end, that being must be corrected \u2014 even killed. This is why mages call Thread Cutters Euthanists. Sometimes the title is ironic; Thread Cutters are not always gentle and, once convinced of the rightness of an action, never merciful.</div><div>Thread Cutters are dedicated to what they believe are natural laws. To violate one\u2019s purpose or live beyond one\u2019s destined ending is a crime against nature. Atlantis turned into a bloated tyranny that tried to extend its life on the backs of the gods. This crime wounded Creation itself; the Legacy preserves what\u2019s left. Euthanists believe that all other laws are subservient to this so-called Mahadharma. The customs of a Consilium or order is of no consequence if the customs must be violated for the sake of the Great Law. </div><div>The Legacy\u2019s faithful believe that they are duty bound (Indian members call it their dharma) to force people and institutions to fulfill their \u201ctrue purpose\u201d \u2014 but only for as long as Fate decrees that they should exist. Thread Cutters define this as the ability of the subject to do his, her or its duty without causing undue harm. The Legacy has a reputation for solving problems with torture and assassination, but the truth of the matter is that most of the Thread Cutters\u2019 work is nonviolent. Destroying a decrepit corporation through bankruptcy is easier than killing.</div><div>Thread Cutters hail from many, far-flung cultures, but most are profoundly influenced by Indo-European mythology. The first Euthanists followed Indo-European migration. The Legacy\u2019s beliefs evolved alongside those of the Indians, Iranians, Greeks and Celts, but whether mages inspired the people or vice versa may never be known. In any event, the Legacy reveres what it believes to be the archetypes behind these peoples\u2019 most ancient gods. The Legacy as a whole calls them the Three, but individual sects give them local names.</div><div>The Three are manifestations of the Mahadharma. In cosmic roles, they are the Creator, Preserver and Destroyer. In the context of individual lives, they are Maiden, Mother and Crone, or Weaver, Measurer and Cutter. When pressed to find a culture-neutral term, Thread Cutters call them Beginning, Being and Ending. The Three can be male or female. They wear as many masks as needed, sending these avatars to offer revelations to the devout. In such guises, the Three visited the first Euthanists and charged them with preserving the Great Law.</div><div>Thread Cutters do not believe that the Three are gods in the sense of being powerful, immortal individuals. They may show themselves in that fashion, but in truth, each is a living cosmic principle that is endowed with a vast intelligence and limitless power. Despite their might, the Three do not break their own rules; to deal with those who would abuse and twist the Great Law, the Three need free-willed humans.</div>",alternateNickname:"Euthanists",orders:"Thread Cutters are wolves in the fold of Awakened society. Only Guardians of the Veil formally accept Legacy members. Even so, a known Euthanist is unlikely to ever reach a high station within the order because of fears that her dedication to the Mahadharma will conflict with Guardian agendas. The order prefers to let Thread Cutters work in their own cabals, isolated from other Guardians. Even so, there are many times when Guardian and Thread Cutter ideologies mesh. Euthanist Guardians earn more honor than trust, but that honor is considerable.<div>Otherwise, the only other order that openly deals with Thread Cutters is the Free Council. Thread Cutters have deep, long-lived ties to Fallen World civilizations and are not especially enamored of Atlantean pomp. Plus, the Legacy concerns itself with Sleepers\u2019 well-being as a matter of course. Nevertheless, the Euthanists follow their own dharmas, and are willing to break any agreement that gets in the way. The Legacy\u2019s more cold-blooded tactics also dissuade Libertines from getting too involved.</div><div>The Silver Ladder and Adamantine Arrow believe the Legacy is despicable. Th\xe9archs have no tolerance for mages who would ignore Lex Magica whenever it suits them, and Arrow mages don\u2019t like to deal with habitual oath-breakers. Members of both orders rarely agree with the Euthanists\u2019 intimation that Atlantis deserved to die. Still, Thread Cutters have joined these orders before. Th\xe9archs and Arrows appreciate that the Legacy tends to cull the weaknesses out of the organizations they join.</div><div>Thread Cutters have little interest in the Mysterium, but the reverse is not true. The order\u2019s scholar-mages are fascinated (if mostly ignorant) of the Legacy\u2019s philosophy and magical theories. Finally, a significant number of Thread Cutters are apostates. Some Lineages have been submerged within particular societies for so long that Atlantis and the finding of the Three is less important than its members\u2019 modern roles as priests and gurus.</div>",appearance:"Thread Cutters avoid undue attention whenever possible, but they do tend to adopt a simple, reserved style.

Many mages rush upon the Mysteries with a newfound sense of purpose, but there are those for whom Supernal revelations bring no comfort. Prospective Thread Cutters often Awaken with a sense of shock and despair. They\u2019ve discovered that the world is a lie and that malevolent, intelligent powers twist it to their desires.<div>Thrust into such a world, these mages find little comfort within the paranoid, duplicitous milieu of Awakened society. Men and women duel to the death over the most abstract secrets, all the while claiming to do it in the name of spiritual enlightenment or salvation for all. If a mage can\u2019t stand the corruption and wishes to cleave to a higher law, the Legacy might find him.</div><div>Attaining the soul of a Thread Cutter comforts these mages. They find a purpose that is intolerant of evil, objective and, after a fashion, compassionate. A Euthanist\u2019s duties are dangerous and imperil the spirit, but at least they serve a noble end.</div>",organizzation:"Thread Cutters meet secretly whenever it is possible to do so.

Order rankings are irrelevant, as are all intermediary marks of distinction.<div>In these meetings, members discuss their current projects, settle any disputes that may arise during the course of their work and share the lore of the Legacy with one another. Moral support takes up no small part of these gatherings. Only a master (pramatar is Sanskrit for \u201cjudge\u201d) or three initiated chelas may interfere with another Thread Cutter\u2019s work. In the most formal situations, the Legacy holds a trial consisting of a pramatar judge, one chela as prosecutor and one as defender. Thread Cutters know that assuming the role of executioner and fate-twister goes hand-in-hand with severe temptation, and watch each other closely to keep themselves from acting for themselves over Mahadharma.</div><div>As many Thread Cutters are also Guardians of the Veil, many Thread Cutters also cultivate cults and secret societies according to the Labyrinth customs of Guardian tradition. Thread Cutters make great use of these in their mission to fulfill the Mahadharma, but are quick to punish those who would treat death lightly.

While most of the Awakened refugees set their sights on survival first, the forebears of the Legacy looked inward. They wanted to understand why Atlantis fell. The Legacy\u2019s first guru (whose name is lost to time) Awakened with knowledge of the Three. He (or she) demonstrated the attainments of his soul and codified the Thread Cutters\u2019 teachings. At his command, the first Euthanists became ascetics and beggars.</div><div>The Euthanists believe that they journeyed to every corner of the world, but as far as they know, the only successful settlements lived among ancient peoples in the Ukraine and Asia Minor. Unlike many exiles, the Thread Cutters threw themselves at the mercy of the Sleepers. The rough tribes the Thread Cutters encountered remembered Atlantean raids and conquests. They treated mages harshly, forcing them to live among offal and corpses. Over the centuries, the Thread Cutters\u2019 ancestors found a place within these tribes, performing \u201cunclean\u201d tasks such as burials and butchery.</div><div>About 5,000 years ago, the herdsmen and warriors that Thread Cutters followed began to settle South Asia and Europe. Archeologists would call these settlers the Indo European peoples. They spawned hundreds of related languages and religions. Bound to these diverse beliefs were the Three. Euthanists worshipped them under many names, but the Sleepers of Europe themselves treated the Three as ambivalent or evil figures, as necessary as they were terrible. South Asian civilizations gave the Three a higher place, as manifestations of one God. Accordingly, Thread Cutters acquired influence</div><div>in South Asia that persists to the present day. Otherwise, Euthanists spoke for the dark forces that threaten the thunder and sun gods of a thousand people\u2019s pantheons. Even though the Indo European peoples turned to monotheism and philosophy, its Sleepers remembered the Three and told tales of the witches who did the work of the Three. When Shakespeare wrote of three \u201cweird sisters\u201d in the doom of Macbeth, he invoked the shadow of the Thread Cutters.</div><div>When the British Empire destroyed the Thugee cult, the British did so with the approval of the Euthanists, who wanted to see the fall of a conspiracy that had outlived its purpose. Kali, manifestation of Ending, needed subtler servants.This brings us to the modern age, when Thread Cutters hide among mages, doing their secret work for the benefit of all. Euthanists claim partial credit for a diverse, strong Awakened community because they \u201ccut out the rot,\u201d but that is not their entire goal. They simply do what is necessary. The great orders, the old philosophies and the mightiest nations of the world are slipping into old age. One day, the Legacy may judge that some of the core institutions of the Sleepers and Wise are at their Ending.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Cults of the Three</h3><div>The Thread Cutters are a truly ancient Legacy. Initiates contemplate the paradox of a Legacy that is obsessed with impermanence, yet has survived, continuously, for at least 7,000 years. Euthanist pramatars say that the Thread Cutters renew themselves by adapting to their environment.</div><div>Calling the Three by their universal names is rare; the Legacy prefers the names they have within Sleeper faiths and myths. Bereft of a memory of Atlantis, Sleepers constantly reinvent themselves. Thread Cutters use this cultural dynamism to renew their own organization, learning a little more about the Three through the faces they present to the world. Some Thread Cutters are so ensconced in their own faiths that they barely recognize foreign comrades, but even after millennia of adaptation, most of them can identify one another through certain secret signs and beliefs.</div><div>Following Indo European migration, the Legacy has formed a number of distinct cults, fellowships and ancestral cabals. The following three have the broadest reach; mages might find their adherents anywhere in the world.</div><ul><li><b>Aided:</b> Propelled by the Celtic revival, Aided (\u201cDeath\u201d) mages recruit a larger percentage of Euthanists now than at any other point in their known history. The Aided can reliably trace their history back at least 800 years, and that limit only exists because their accounts grow unreliable past that point. Aided see the Three in the Triple Goddess, and specifically where she destroys heroessuch as C\xfa Chulaind. Similar to the Morrigan, Aided make great use of entangled Geasa (magical bans) and Buada (blessings) to work magic. Aided mages value treachery and twisted oaths as tools to secure an Ending and deplore mere \u201cCraft,\u201d or magic used to serve a selfish end. This puts them at odds with a number of other Celtic magical societies, including the Daoine (see Legacies: The Sublime, pp. 33\u201342) and the Sodality of the Tor (ibid, pp. 83\u201394). The Aided have no ill-will toward the Tor, but hate the Daoine\u2019s cavalier approach to Fate.</li><li><b>Devasu:</b> The Devasu (\u201cDivine Arrow\u201d) take their name from the arrows of Rudra, aspect of Shiva and lord of disease. At 1,000 years of age, the current cult is the successor of an older cult called the Sapindya Satandanda (\u201cConsanguinity of Eternal Joy\u201d) that destroyed itself when its members believed that it had reached its own Ending. Members are tantric practitioners who believe that defying Ending blocks cosmic shakti: the living energy of creation. The Devasu praxis concerns the divine attributes of deities from the Vedas and Bhagavad-Gita. Through self-purification, these mages become manifestations (avataras) of these gods on Earth. Of all the Euthanist cults, the Devasu may be the most ritualistic, advocating specific forms of Ending for members of various professions, temples and businesses. The cult harvests Mana from these acts.</li><li><b>Eumenides:</b> The \u201cKindly Ones\u201d style themselves after the Furies of Greek and Roman mythology and consider themselves to be the servants of the Fates. Various Greco Roman cults have existed throughout Thread Cutter history. The Eumenides trace their roots to a hidden society of Greek nobles. In the mid-18th century, these aristocrats revived Classical traditions within their secret rites. In their hunger for more occult knowledge, they opened a Cretan tomb containing the secrets of the Legacy. The cult has since discovered that this is the way of things: Greek branches of the Thread Cutters discover the secrets of their ancestors, take up the banner of the Fates and meet their doom a few centuries later \u2014 but not before leaving their own secrets for successors.</li></ul><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>The roots of Thread Cutter beliefs are the Three: divine concepts that guide the cycle of birth and death. Everything has a purpose and natural lifespan. Thread Cutters use their Arts, Attainments and philosophy to divine what a person or thing\u2019s purpose is, whether it is fulfilling that aim and whether or not it should continue to exist. Most Euthanists concentrate on particular types of people or institutions. One might study financial institutions and another, police officers. But Thread Cutters don\u2019t limit themselves to their special interests. If they see a life out of balance, they do what they can to correct it.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Euthanists\u2019 Dharma</h3><div>Thread Cutters use a term from Indian spirituality \u2014 dharma \u2014 to describe the inherent purpose all beings have. Euthanists know what their dharma is: to change and destroy according to the Mahadharma. Mahadharma teaches them to analyze a situation, categorize its current place among the Three and, when necessary, how to intervene.</div><div>A person or organization can be enmeshed in Beginning, Being and Ending. If the subject is in the cycle of Beginning, it\u2019s the mage\u2019s duty to ensure his (or her, or its) growth. Outsiders rarely talk about how Euthanists cure sick children or use magic to give a struggling new business a windfall, but these interventions are quite common. This is not always a function of raw age. A young child with an incurable illness can be at the cusp of Ending. An old man, freed from his life\u2019s obligations, may embark on a new Beginning as an artist. Euthanists not only remove impediments to new growth, but ensure that subjects follow their true purpose. They remove criminals that would corrupt a new business, or might spirit a young woman far away from a destructive family or community.</div><div>A mature subject enters the phase of Being, where the subject must cleave closely to its dharma. Thread Cutters believe a proper dharma consists of the subject\u2019s aspirations combined with the prospect that he will benefit those ensnared in his destiny. There is a delicate balance between these elements. A business that means well but cripples local economic health is acting against its dharma; a murderer whose victims would have gone on to kill or corrupt is following his true dharma. If a subject violates his dharma, Euthanists employ a series of escalating tactics to correct him. These start with methods by which the mage acts indirectly, foiling the target\u2019s plans, turning friends against him and offering rewards for correct actions. If these fail, Euthanists take a direct hand in affairs. They use threats, torture, blackmail and other extreme tools to achieve their aim.</div><div>If even this fails, the subject is irreparable; he, she or it has come to the time of Ending. That is the nature of this cycle, for Ending is the time when a person or organization is no longer fit to do its duty. Sadly, too many people refuse to let go of their failed ambitions and ruined lives, so it falls to the Thread Cutters to set things right. The Legacy is infamous for their murderous, destructive acts, but most of these are carefully considered. It isn\u2019t always necessary to destroy the subject, but total renewal, while a fine ideal, is difficult to achieve. Euthanists often deal with psychopaths, servants of the Abyss and blood-drinking monsters and have no compunctions about putting them out of their misery.</div><div>Thread Cutters prefer to inflict painless deaths, but as most Thread Cutters believe in reincarnation, the type of Ending is important. Some Legacy members believe that various forms of corruption merit specific Endings by fire, water, a blade or strangulation. For example, the Devasu cult holds that it is best to kill a holy man by opening the top of his skull. Temples to certain gods must fall to fire; others, to flood.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Knives Behind the Throne</h3><div>Needless to say, Thread Cutters\u2019 actions do not sit well with other mages. Awakened society values its laws. They ensure a measure of liberty and peace among people who might otherwise kill each other with a wrathful chant, gesture or even a thought. The Euthanists respect the Lex Magica only as far as it suits them, ignoring it to dispatch mages to their Endings or otherwise meddle in prohibited affairs.</div><div>Thus, mages who value law and order distrust Thread Cutters. As a result, the Legacy is a secret society among secret societies. Most Thread Cutters are nominal members of the Guardians of the Veil, but only serve the order\u2019s political agenda as far as it suits their own esoteric aims. This isn\u2019t to say that the Euthanists are unheard of. In fact, Thread Cutters loom large in legends, where they kill and torture arrogant mages \u2014 or mages who break strange, faerie tale rules. Despite this, few mages have knowingly met a member of the Legacy. Thread Cutters know their reputations (and some use them quite effectively over the course of their duties) and keep a low profile. In effect, they are willing outcasts, unable to share the fullness of their doctrine with others. Thread Cutters usually make an effort to avoid murder and violence and will counsel potential targets to avoid a \u201cbad end,\u201d but never in such a way that they would reveal their Legacy-driven motives.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Left-Handed?</h4><div>Thread Cutters figure in well known stories, but living members of the Legacy rarely reveal themselves. The stories paint the Thread Cutters as the rigid executioners of moral laws or as capricious killers and meddlers, punishing victims for infractions they didn\u2019t know existed.</div><div>As a consequence, there is no consensus as to whether the Legacy is acceptable or \u201cLeft-Handed.\u201d When Thread Cutters have revealed themselves, they\u2019ve provided considerable help, but were so cavalier about the Lex Magica that many of them were punished with death or exile.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Thread Cutters use the Three as the model for Thread Cutter training. A newly Awakened mage serves the Beginning. Reborn into enlightenment, she explores her new world. Tutors let new mages explore their powers and perceptions freely, because their charges are experiencing a burst of creative power that they will never feel again.</div><div>After a mage begins formal occult study, she passes into the realm of Being. She tempers her raw power with discipline. Normally, her tutor teaches her the Mysteries alongside the beliefs of the Euthanists. At this stage, the tutor encourages his charge to develop an alternate identity. This protects her and gives her a refuge (a \u201cnormal life\u201d) within the world of Being, while, over time, she learns to serve the cause of Ending. Eventually, a Thread Cutter learns the occult beliefs, ethics and techniques of the Legacy, and it is time to fully enter the Way of Ending. Full initiation entails a form of temporary death called the Agama (\u201crevelation\u201d). This is a rote that suspends the target\u2019s life and plunges her soul into the Underworld. Bound to a ghostly form, she searches for the lost path to Stygia. No mage has successfully mapped this route, but it is said that the closer one gets, the more one learns from the journey.</div><div>As many Thread Cutters are Guardians of the Veil, tutors often integrate the order and Legacy initiations into one ordeal. In this case, the study of Being occurs alongside the Crimson Veil, and the Agama rite occurs after passing through the Black Veil. See Mage: The Awakening (pp. 44\u201346) and Guardians of the Veil for more information about the Veils of initiation.</div><div>Experienced mages are not required to pass through the Beginning stages of training, and take their old lives as their Being identities. Thus, an experienced initiate (pupils usually require a Gnosis of 3 and third-degree Disciple status, with Fate or Death as one of the Disciple-level Arcana) can pass through initiation in a matter of months, but must still endure the Agama rite. Only fully initiated mages are allowed to perform the Legacy\u2019s work. They have passed into full knowledge of Endings.</div>",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"Thread Cutter Attainments exist to help initiates guard the Mahadharma.

In game terms, this affects rolls that relate to Contacts, Fame and Status Merits. In conjunction with Fame, the Attainment can be particularly disastrous, because is affects nearly every social interaction.

The Earth, he said, occupied the center of the universe. Around the Earth, concentric crystal spheres carried the Sun, Moon, planets and finally the fixed stars.

Each crystal sphere was another rung between Earth and the imperishable stars where the Supreme Godhead dwelled. Sleeper mystics tried to climb this ladder through visions, rituals and appeals to the gods and spirits of each planet. The founders of the Thrice-Great understood that the stars were merely a symbol for the Supernal World; they tried to Ascend by way of the Shadow Realm and the planetary spirits who dwelled there. They did not beg or pray, either. The Thrice-Great believed that a mage who found the right formulas could command, and the gods themselves would obey. These forceful mages, true followers of the Path of the Mighty, therefore became experts at dealing with spirits. They believed (or discovered) that each planet bore mystic affinities to phenomena on Earth: plants, animals, parts of the human body, gemstones, metals, colors, musical tones and numbers. By adding these substances and qualities to their spells, they could attract the forces and spirits of a particular planet \u2014 and compel them.</div><div>The Thrice-Great called their mystical doctrine Hermeticism, after the god of passage between worlds.

By the later Roman period, mystics said Hermes Trismegistos was a mortal wizard and prophet \u2014 the first prophet in fact, whose doctrine was older (and therefore more authoritative) than other mystic stalwarts such as Moses and Zoroaster. The Stargazers say, however, that Thrice-Great Hermes was fully historical: Sleeper history knows him as the Greek astronomer Hipparchos, who lived from 190 to 120 BC.</div><div>Hipparchos is one of the key figures in the history of astronomy. Orthodox history does not describe him as mystic, but even Sleeper historians have recently figured out that he triggered a religious revolution. Hipparchos discovered the precession of the equinoxes: that the point in the zodiac where the sun rises at the start of spring and autumn slowly moves, taking 26,000 years to make a complete circle. This incidentally means the celestial pole isn't constant, either. It slowly traces a circle in the sky, so one star after another becomes the pole star. In Hipparchos' time, the Sun rose in the constellation of Aries, the Ram, at the spring equinox, but 2,000 years before, the Sun rose in Taurus, the Bull. And in a century or two, the Sun would rise in Pisces, the Fishes. The sunrise at equinox currently approaches the constellation of Aquarius, the Water-Carrier.</div><div>In the Ptolemaic model, the entire universe spun around the Earth, completing one circuit each day. The Sun, Moon and planets moved more slowly against this daily background. The system was self-contained. Hipparchos discovered a grander motion superimposed on the system. Some force was tipping the entire universe, making it wobble like a top about to fall!</div><div>When Claudius Ptolemy recorded Hipparchos\u2019 discovery, Ptolemy simply described the precession of the equinoxes as a fact, without trying to explain it. Mystics saw the hand of the Supreme Godhead \u2014 no longer dwelling inside the universe but beyond it, turning the cosmos and bending the path of the poles.</div><div>The Thrice-Great say that Hipparchos himself Awakened when he realized some force must exist outside the cosmos he could observe. Over the years, he learned the star-magic of Mesopotamia and the god-magic of Egypt, and then quested into the Shadow Realm to find the spirits of the planets. He Ascended the celestial spheres to the sphere of the stars and cried out, demanding to pass and face the One Beyond.</div><div>Hipparchos received an answer from the Oracle of the Golden Key itself, whom the Thrice-Great call Aion. The Oracle gave Hipparchos the powers of the Legacy and told him how to use his Attainments. Aion also explained the affinities that still linked the material, planetary and Supernal realms. The astronomer returned from his celestial voyage as Thrice-Great Hermes, the Oracle\u2019s own messenger to the Fallen World. The Thrice-Great say their founder never truly died, but climbed the Planetary Ladder again and jumped across the Abyss to the Supernal World.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Thrice-Great During the Roman Empire</h3><div>Hipparchos\u2019 discoveries, both astronomical and metaphysical, spread far beyond the Legacy he founded. The early Thrice-Great did not keep their doctrines secret. In fact, they tried to teach every educated, philosophically minded person they could find, in hopes they would Awaken as Hipparchos. After so many centuries, of course, the modern Thrice-Great have little hard evidence of their forebears\u2019 activities, but modern Thrice-Great point to circumstantial evidence of the Legacy\u2019s influence.</div><div>The far-flung but secretive religion of Mithraism, for instance, built temples filled with astronomical symbolism.

Some Gnostics associated these false gods with the deities of the planetary spheres. The true god dwelt outside the realms of matter, spirit and the visible heavens.</div><div>In each written dialogues of the Corpus Hermeticum, a divine figure tells an eager mortal how souls come from a higher, purer realm.

No one now can say how much of the Thrice-Great methods the Chaldean Oracles revealed: only fragments of the book survive through quotations by other writers. The Guardians of the Veil say they worked for centuries to suppress the Chaldean Oracles. If they still own any copies, they certainly won\u2019t admit it.</div><div>The purest statement of Thrice-Great ideas to Sleepers came through the Neoplatonist mystics of the fourth through sixth centuries AD. The Neoplatonists combined philosophy with magic rituals from the Chaldean Oracles. Indeed, the Thrice-Great say many of these now-obscure mystics were members of their Legacy.</div><div>The Neoplatonists insisted on sticking to Greek religious forms after the Roman Empire made Christianity the state religion. The Thrice-Great Legacy died out in Europe with the suppression of the last Neoplatonic academy. Nevertheless, the Stargazers regard the Neoplatonist movement as their Legacy\u2019s golden age. They seek to recover lost works by their Neoplatonist forebears, for many Thrice-Great believe several of these Awakened philosophers matched Hipparchos\u2019 epic journey and brought back powerful secrets about the planetary spirits and the Supernal World.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Medieval Hiatus</h3><div>After the suppression of the Neoplatonists, the Thrice-Great survived in secret among scholars of the new Muslim empire. Unfortunately, while Muslim savants preserved a great deal of Classical astronomy and philosophy, Islam was no friendlier than Christianity to the idea of planetary spirits. The Legacy, and its lore about planetary spirits, declined simply because it was hard for members to find each other, share information and assist in training each others\u2019 pupils. Still, Muslim Stargazers added a few texts to the Corpus Hermeticum.</div><div>The Thrice-Great achieved a few small revivals in this period, though. Most notably, Legacy members gathered at the court of Ulugh Begh, in 15th-century Samarkand. Astronomy fascinated this grandson of the conqueror Timur. His observatory compiled the most accurate star tables and calculations of planetary motion the world had yet seen. Under cover of this research, the Thrice-Great restored contact with many powerful spirits of the planets. The mages who currently occupy the Legacy\u2019s hidden sanctum, however, are not Thrice-Great and refuse to let modern Hermetics search for lost secrets of their forebears.</div><div>Meanwhile, the Thrice-Great Legacy filtered back into Europe along with the rest of Classical learning. By the 15th century, European mages actively sought to reclaim the secrets of Greek and Roman willworkers. Sleepers also rediscovered the Corpus Hermeticum, much to the Guardians of the Veil\u2019s collective annoyance.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>A Troubled Transition</h3><div>The leading figures of this Hermetic Revival gathered in Italy. The Sleeper Classicist and mystic Marsilio Ficino almost let the Hermetic Mysteries escape through his translations and commentaries on the Corpus Hermeticum, but he misunderstood what he read through his lack of an Awakened perspective. His Awakened readers, however, recognized what he got wrong and sought corrected information.</div><div>Some of these new Thrice-Great wanted to spread the word as badly as their Neoplatonist forebears. The Legacy\u2019s most determined publicist for this period was surely the magus Fabio Paolini, whose Hebdomades described in explicit detail how to evoke planetary spirits and draw on their power for willworking. The Guardians of the Veil retaliated with Cornelius Agrippa\u2019s Three Books of Occult Philosophy, meant to lay out the Guardians\u2019 usual deluding mix of incomplete truths and convincing lies. Agrippa was not as good a pawn as the Guardians hoped. His work revealed more of the truth than the Guardians intended. On the other hand, a few Sleepers every century Awaken from dabbling with Agrippa\u2019s methods; the Thrice-Great sometimes list Agrippa as their pawn, if they feel like annoying Guardian colleagues.</div><div>Just as Europe\u2019s new Hermetics congratulated themselves on recovering ancient powers, a Polish bishop pulled the rug out from their enterprise. Nicolaus Copernicus\u2019 argument that everything revolved around the Sun, not the Earth, rocked the mystical and scientific communities as thoroughly as Hipparchos\u2019 discoveries had done 16 centuries before. No one took it worse than the Thrice-Great. If the Earth was merely one planet among other planets, what did that do to the crystal spheres and spirit realms that Thrice-Great doctrine called the remains of the Celestial Ladder?</div><div>Each century after Copernicus brought new shocks. Galileo found moons around Jupiter, something never revealed by centuries of Thrice-Great dealings with Jovian spirits. During the 18th century, William Herschel discovered a new planet, eventually named Uranus, which had never appeared in Hermetic plans. The stars didn\u2019t occupy a crystal shell; they were distant suns. Nineteenth-century astronomers found the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, then Neptune orbiting beyond Uranus. The 20th century brought Pluto, a tiny world whose madcap orbit sometimes brought it within the orbit of Neptune. By the century\u2019s end, Pluto was demoted from planet to the largest known member of the Kuiper Belt of icy planetoids, with an inconceivably vast Oort Cloud of other small, icy bodies beyond that.</div><div>The Legacy\u2019s official response to each new discovery has been to ignore it. All the discoveries of modern astronomy, the Thrice-Great leaders declared, are but deceptions placed by the Exarchs. Before the fall of Atlantis, Earth was the center of the universe, the planets did ride on crystal spheres and the planetary spirit courts in the Shadow Realm do occupy the surviving rungs of the Celestial Ladder. This attitude, unfortunately, made the Thrice-Great into dogmatic foes of the mages who would form the Free Council. Bad feeling persists on both sides.</div><div>The sheer diversity of magical doctrines now available to contemporary mages also erodes the Thrice-Great\u2019s claims to ancient authority. The Hermetics certainly wield great power, but not enough to render them clearly superior to other Legacies. The Hermetics\u2019 methods are also undeniably cumbersome. The Legacy enjoyed a surge in recruitment during the 1960s, when interest in astrology made newly Awakened mages receptive to the Thrice-Great\u2019s claims of ancient wisdom. Recruitment dropped off again, however, and the Legacy is clearly in decline. After 2,000 years of reaching for the sky, will the Thrice-Great  finally crash to Earth?</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society</h2><div>The Thrice-Great hold a high opinion of themselves. All the Awakened are special people, of course \u2014 but how many Legacies formed through the direct command of an Oracle? An Oracle that continues to send messages to its disciples, the Thrice-Great say. The Stargazers claim Aion itself as the leader of their Legacy, with Hermes Trismegistos and other Ascended Masters, or Ipsissimi, as the Oracle\u2019s assistants in the Supernal World.</div><div>Here in the Fallen World, however, the Legacy has no single leader. The head of each lodge takes the title of Pontifex. Each Pontifex has the Legacy\u2019s third Attainment but otherwise achieves his office only by persuading other Hermetics to follow him and form a lodge. The Pontifices entice Hermetics from other lodges by bragging about the quantities of lore the lodge has gathered, the lodge\u2019s influence in the planetary sprit courts, and their own power. The greatest boast for a Hermetic, of course, is to Ascend the ladder of planetary spheres and return with a new message from Aion. Such a Thrice-Great takes the title of Magister Caelestis.</div><div>Thrice-Great receive lesser titles based on their Attainments. A Hermetic with all three Attainments is a Dominus. The second Attainment brings the rank of Philosophus, while a Stargazer with only the first Attainment is a Practicus. Apprentices not yet initiated are addressed as Zelator. In formal communications (including lodge meetings), a Thrice-Great is expected to begin with another Hermetic\u2019s rank in the Legacy, order and Arcana mastery: for instance, \u201cPhilosophus Deacon Chrysantius, Disciple in the Third Degree.\u201d For the rest of the encounter, Thrice-Great may limit themselves to the other mage\u2019s rank in the Legacy.</div><div>Stargazers typically choose shadow names in Greek or Latin, and assign such names to their apprentices. Shadow names may express some ideal or hoped-for achievement (such as Telephassa, \u201cFar Shiner\u201d), or just \u201cclassicize\u201d a contemporary name (such as turning Kurtz into Curtius). Names of ancient philosophers and astronomers such as Anaxagoras or Hypatia are also used.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Celestial Power</h3><div>The Thrice-Great believe that as they gain Attainments, their souls become more similar to that of their patron Aion. This creates a sympathetic link between the Fallen World and Supernal World. The more of the Fallen World the Hermetics bring under their influence, the more easily Aion can reach into the mortal realm to spark more Awakenings. They also strengthen Aion\u2019s position in the Supernal World: as below, so above.</div><div>As members of the Silver Ladder, Thrice-Great mages often seek influence in politics, business or other worldly institutions. A few Hermetics use their magic to advance their careers and gain social power directly. More often, though, a Hermetic stays in the background. Instead of becoming mayor or running a million-dollar business, the Stargazer works in the City Hall mailroom or at the coffee shop where the executives congregate. The mage nudges events through covert magic, sympathetic links or spirit minions. It\u2019s less direct, but safer.</div><div>Thrice-Great also seek influence in the spirit courts associated with the planets. Thrice-Great know the rulers of each planetary court, whom they call Archons, will not help rebuild the Celestial Ladder \u2014 not unless the Thrice-Great force them somehow. Some Hermetics suspect the Archons may be trusties for the Exarchs. At the very least, Thrice-Great tutors say, the Archons do not care about human affairs or anything humans could comprehend.</div><div>Only an archmage could hope to bind an Archon. Fortunately, the planetary courts include spirits of every power level. The lesser gods wield enough power for most of a mage\u2019s purposes. Legacy members build their power step-by-step, drawing minor planetary spirits to their service and using them as envoys to greater spirits. When a Hermetic cannot compel, he dickers and bribes until he can forge a lasting contract for particular services \u2014 and gain audience with the next tier of the spirit court.</div><div>Following the example set by the great Paolini, Hermetics call planetary spirits henads \u2014 \u201csevens\u201d \u2014 to distinguish them from other spirits. Between the seven planetary courts, Thrice-Great can recruit henads with almost any Influence they need. Thrice-Great doctrine holds that to send a call across the Abyss, a mage needs backing from all seven planetary courts. A high-ranking henad must grant the mage an honorary rank in the court, increasing the mage\u2019s authority over spirits of that planet. This special status comes with a new name the mage uses with spirits of that planet as a sort of password. When a Stargazer collects password-names from all seven courts, he may seek the final celestial realm, the sphere of the stars, and call to Aion.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Revelations from Aion</h3><div>Once a Thrice-Great possesses all three Attainments and all seven passwords to the planetary courts, she may climb the ladder of celestial spheres and seek a revelation from Aion. Thrice-Great tradition says some Celestial Masters returned with fourth Attainments \u2014 all different, all awesomely powerful. Others returned as archmages . . . and others did not return at all, because Aion pulled them into the Supernal World.</div><div>In verifiable, modern history, however, Aion\u2019s revelations have proved less spectacular. A Celestial Master returns with merely a new rote \u2014 conveniently, for some feat of magic the Stargazer has already performed many times \u2014 or a useful tidbit of lore. Skeptics also suggest the communications from Aion seem less than divine in their wisdom. Exhortations to guide the Sleepers in the paths of wisdom and protect them from the Abyss and the Seers are high-minded enough but a bit . . . hackneyed, as if some merely human intellect tried to come up with something a superhumanly wise spiritual master ought to say.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>New Merit: Celestial Name (\u2022 to \u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022\u2022)</h4><div>When a planetary god gives a Stargazer a new name, it confers a minor, honorary rank in the spirit court of that planet. The new name acts as a password to enter that court: the mage still must obey all the court\u2019s rules, but at least hostile henads may give the mage a chance to talk.</div><div>The Hermetic also gains a +1 bonus to all dice pools for interacting with spirits of that court, whether magically or socially. For instance, the mage gains the bonus to summon this class of henads, to compel them or banish them, or to attempts to persuade or negotiate with the spirits using mundane Skills. The Thrice-Great does not gain the bonus for outright attacks on the spirit (including use of the third Attainment).</div><div>Given time, power and successful negotiations with high-ranking spirits, a mage could parlay a Celestial Name into actual Status in the planetary court. This would confer greater authority over lower-ranking spirits but also mean obligations toward higher-ranking spirits, so Thrice-Great are cautious about pursuing this route. A Celestial Name is pure privilege. Status in multiple spirit courts also tends to cause conflicts of interest, while the point of Celestial Names is to collect them from all seven planetary courts.</div>",magic:"<h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Magic</h2><div>The quick, on-the-fly spellcasting of Thrice Great mages looks much the same as that of any other willworker. They prefer wands and disks as Path tools. A Hermetic\u2019s disk sometimes takes the form of an astrolabe (a device for measuring a star\u2019s position; it looks like a disk with a crossbar for sighting). The defining tool for the Thrice-Great, however, is the strophados. This device consists of a golden ball on a cord. The mage swings the strophados to imitate the circling motion of the heavens. Thrice-Great generally engrave their strophados with a diagram and sigils representing the position of the planets at the time of their Awakening. A Thrice-Great strophados also unscrews so the mage can load it with substances sympathetic to the planet whose power or spirits she wants to invoke. The strophados is essential for extended spellcasting and is a favored tool for summoning planetary spirits or opening roads to the Shadow Realm.</div><div>Thrice-Great magic becomes most distinctive when these mages engage in extended casting in their sanctums. A Hermetic collects a wide range of substances with affinities to the planets, from bolts of colored cloth to body parts from different animals. For a full ritual, a Thrice-Great draws a magic circle marked with the signs of the zodiac and the current positions of the planets, with chords drawn to mark relationships such as opposition, trine, sextile and square.</div><div>The Hermetic strengthens the influence of planets that relate to his intended feat of magic by placing the proper substances on their sigils. The chamber of the ritual may also be hung with cloth of the proper color; corresponding perfumes scent the air. As part of the ritual, the Thrice-Great may also play notes associated with the planets he invokes, using a lyre or similar instrument. Especially long rites can include a chanted recitation of a hymn by the Greek poets Homer or Hesiod to a god associated with the planet. The Hermetic also swings the strophados. The total time spent whirling the strophados must exceed one time increment for extended spellcasting, as set by the mage\u2019s Gnosis (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 76), so extended spellcasting can be quite strenuous for novice Stargazers.</div><div>This elaborate paraphernalia grants the Thrice-Great certain benefits to spellcasting. (They are not usually feasible for instant spellcasting.)</div><ul><li>All cooperative spellcasting by Thrice-Great mages gains a +1 bonus to teamwork rolls, as if they belonged to a symbolic cabal. This applies to instant as well as ritual spellcasting, but requires the use of at least three planetary correspondences.</li><li>Combined spellcasting is easier. Using at least five planetary affinities cancels the penalty for one spell in a combined casting. For instance, a Thrice-Great could cast two spells at once, without raising the effective Arcana ratings of the spells or suffering a \u20132 penalty to the dice pools for casting each spell. (This does not enable a Thrice-Great to cast more spells at once than his Gnosis would allow, though.)</li><li>At least three planetary affinities in a spell counters \u20131 dice of any other penalties to the mage\u2019s spellcasting dice pool. Five affinities cancel 2 dice of penalty.</li><li>Use of at least three planetary correspondences reduces the Paradox dice pool by 1. Use of five affinities reduces the Paradox dice pool by 2. Other mages do not gain these benefits by using Hermetic methods and planetary correspondences: other mages\u2019 souls lack a Thrice-Great\u2019s sympathy for planetary energies.</li></ul><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Astrological Magic</h3><div>No one can say when humans first associated magic with the planets. By the Renaissance, Sleeper astrologers no longer believed the planets were actual gods moving around the sky. Instead, the planets radiated forces that made various events more or less likely \u2014 such as how the Moon controlled the tides, but more subtle. Mars, for instance, governed fire, war and disease. If Mars occupied particular signs of the zodiac or particular angles to other planets, people were more likely to quarrel, get sick or have their homes burn down.</div><div>The Thrice-Great now ascribe these arcane influences to the planetary courts. The tides of celestial power shift according to the planets\u2019 locations and angles to each other in the sky, however, even though the power comes from the Shadow Realm instead of outer space.</div><div>Astrology, therefore, is real \u2014 at least if you\u2019re Awakened. The Silver Ladder has initiated several Acanthus into the Thrice-Great. These mages use astrology for prophecy and fate-weaving. All Hermetic magic involves concentrating the mystic tides to bolster the mage\u2019s spells.</div><div>Planetary Correspondences Thrice-Great use special substances and conditions to attract mystic energies from the planetary spirit courts. The character of each planet suggests Influences for its spirits and a range of magical feats it can empower. The planets do not correspond tidily to specific Arcana or Practices, however, so Thrice-Great (and their players) have some freedom in which planets they invoke in spellcasting.</div><div>The <b>Sun</b> is associated with magic of light (of course), energy, life-force, willpower, healing and augmentation of power. No surprise, the Sun is the favorite \u201cplanet\u201d for Obrimos mages.</div><div>The <b>Moon</b> is the planet of transformation, illusion and everything changeable, from the element of water to emotions and magic itself.</div><div><b>Mercury</b> is associated with thought and motion: investigation and analysis as well as literal travel and exploration. Commerce, theft and divination also fall in this planet\u2019s purview. Mercury\u2019s element is Air.</div><div><b>Venus</b> governs living creatures, fertility, pleasure, love, friendship and all the softer emotions that bring people together. Venus\u2019 element is Earth, but as the abode of life rather than solidity or stability.</div><div><b>Mars</b> is the planet of raw force, sometimes creative but often destructive, the element of fire, war, violent emotions and other disruptions. Mars also governs fever and blood. Venus seduces; Mars overwhelms.</div><div><b>Jupiter</b> is associated with the element of air and weather as well as politics, laws, morals, rulership and justice. Jupiter also governs money, religion and social power in general.</div><div><b>Saturn</b> is the planet of time, age, death and restriction. Saturn\u2019s element is Earth, offering stability and defense as well as limitation or destruction.</div><div>Even Sleeper occultists know that gold and yellow correspond to the Sun, silver and white to the Moon, quicksilver and gray (or mottled colors) to Mercury, copper and green to Venus, iron and red to Mars, tin and blue to Jupiter and lead and black to Saturn. The jewels, animals, plants and other associations of each planet are too diverse to list. Pop-occult books give detailed (and contradictory) lists of planetary correspondences . . . but none should be trusted.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>New and Lost Planets</h3><div>A few Thrice-Great believe the asteroid belt represents a broken \u201crung\u201d in the Celestial Ladder, while the \u201crungs\u201d corresponding to Uranus, Neptune and Pluto were lost to the Abyss when the Ladder broke. A few other Hermetics believe the four missing spirit courts are now scattered, in hiding or imprisoned in some way. These Stargazers think the Celestial Ladder could be mended by restoring the lost spirit courts.</div><div>The majority of Thrice-Great, however, believe such plans are modern, revisionist nonsense. As they point out, tradition gives no correspondences to the asteroids or outer planets. Hermetic Tutors generally cut off \u201cheretical\u201d pupils. The situation might change if a heretic Stargazer could locate a spirit for one of the \u201cnew\u201d planets, or could show some great benefit from creating such spirits.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Spirit Allies</h3><div>A great deal of Thrice-Great magic deals with summoning and controlling henads. The legacy\u2019s masters of Spirit also create planetary spirits \u2014 and after more than 2,000 years, they\u2019ve made significant additions to the planetary courts. Most Hermetics eventually gain henad associates of their own, and the Legacy as a whole claims a host of contacts and allies in the planetary courts. The Thrice-Great define three classes of allied spirits.</div><ul><li><b>Iynges</b> (singular Iynx) are personal familiars. A Thrice-Great can easily create a \u201cfeeding station\u201d for a henad familiar using objects and conditions corresponding to the spirit\u2019s planet. For instance, a spirit of Mars could gain Essence from a wolf\u2019s head mounted on a cedar plaque over a fireplace, flanked by iron swords and with red candles on the mantelpiece; every day, the mage burns an appropriate incense.</li><li><b>Synocheis</b> (\u201cConnectors\u201d; singular, Synocheus) are henads bound to statues to create fetishes. A lodge can\u2019t gain any respect unless it has several Synocheis. Not only do the fetish-statues provide the lodge with Paradox-free powers, the bound henads can contact other spirits and tell them of a Thrice-Great\u2019s desire for an audience. When a lodge breaks up, much of the acrimony centers on who takes possession of the Synocheis. Creating a Synocheus involves placing substances sympathetic to the spirit\u2019s planet within a hollow statue (called a telestika), as well as use of the \u201cCreate Fetish\u201d spell. Synocheis can be represented as Imbued Items or as Retainers.</li><li><b>Teletarchs</b> (\u201cInitiation Masters\u201d) are the greater spirits allied to the Legacy as a whole, bound to respond when a Thrice-Great uses the proper formula. The mage must still persuade the Teletarch and offer it some consideration in return for its aid, just as a mortal Ally. Teletarchs are at least Rank 4, and they can carry appeals to more powerful henads. The formulas for contacting Teletarchs are so valuable that Pontifices and other senior Thrice-Great tend to keep them secret from lesser members \u2014 with the inevitable result that the Legacy has lost the protocols to contact many Teletarchs. These potent spirits would still respond, though, if any mage could rediscover the proper rites.</li></ul><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Initiation</h2><div>A candidate to join the Thrice-Great must first prove her knowledge of Platonist and Neoplatonist philosophy, naked-eye astronomy (enough competence to track the planets through the zodiac) and classical astrology. She must also demonstrate her ability to evoke planetary spirits and perform other magical feats in the Hermetic style. Her examination takes place at a lodge\u2019s main sanctum, before a board of three Hermetics with a minimum rank of Philosophus. The Thrice-Great also call one of the lodge\u2019s Teletarchs, who may ask whatever questions it pleases and examine the candidate\u2019s aura. The divine spirit may veto the candidate\u2019s application at this time, without any need to give a reason. The candidate can try again a year later, with a different Teletarch.</div><div>If the mages and patron god agree that the candidate deserves to join the Legacy, the senior Thrice-Great open a Verge in a special chamber. The lodge\u2019s Synocheis are summoned to add their own auras, giving the ritual chamber the resonance of all seven planets. In this sacred space between material and spiritual, terrestrial and celestial, the tutor guides his pupil in a complex astrological ritual that shapes her soul. After the ceremony, each attending spirit receives a gift of Essence from the lodge.</div><div>The ritual to confer the second Attainment is very similar. A triumvirate of Domini, including the lodge\u2019s Pontifex, verifies the Stargazer\u2019s proficiency as a Disciple of Spirit. While they\u2019re at it, they register his current competency at the other Arcana, too. As a final test, the Thrice-Great himself summons a Teletarch to witnesses the Stargazer\u2019s graduation to the next Attainment. This is usually quite easy, since the divine spirit has been notified of the ceremony and is already nearby.</div><div>The ceremony of the third Attainment happens so rarely that a lodge\u2019s entire membership may gather to witness the event. The ritual itself does not differ greatly from the previous Attainments. The new Dominus, however, ends the ceremony by giving out Essence to as many planetary spirits as wish to attend. The Thrice-Great consider it auspicious if the Dominus can use her new Attainment to convert the sanctum\u2019s Hallow into a temporary locus, while the other Thrice-Great lower the sanctum\u2019s wards and issue a call to every spirit in the area \u2014 an open house and all-you-can-eat spiritual feast. Such events remind the spirits and lodge members of their position as lords of the spirit world. For this reason, most Thrice-Great wait until they become Adepts of both Prime and Spirit before seeking their third Attainment.</div><div>The Thrice-Great hold firm doctrines about fourth Attainments. Such ultimate mastery comes not from any mortal rite but by contacting Aion. The Oracle itself confers a fourth Attainment, which may be different for each mage. As usual with fourth Attainments, however, no Thrice-Great in living memory has provably received this ultimate power.</div>",attainmentsDescrizione:"Thrice-Great mages, in their spirit dealings, use many techniques known to other mages \u2014 true names, offerings, commands in the name of mightier spirits and so on.

This Attainment acts similar to the Spirit 2 \u201cPlace of Power\u201d spell (see Mage: The Awakening, p. 247) except the results are automatic. The Attainment also works at ley nodes, while the spell can only be used at Hallows. If two Hermetics cooperate, their uses of Celestial Beacon do not add; apply the results from the mage with the higher Spirit rating. If the Hermetics oppose each other, however, subtract the less-proficient mage\u2019s Spirit rating from the change wrought by the mage with greater proficiency at Spirit.</div><div>From Twilight or the Shadow Realm, a Thrice-Great who lowers the Gauntlet seems to draw in waves of light that form a sparkling vortex, advertising the lowered Gauntlet to every spirit nearby. Raising the Gauntlet spreads a hard, crystalline darkness as if the location were drowned in obsidian, warning any spirit not to bother attempting a passage. Similar to the spell a Celestial Beacon emulates, a Celestial Beacon lasts one scene.</div><div>A Practicus can also see into Twilight. When the Hermetic uses this aspect of the Attainment, he also gains the benefit of Second Sight, allowing him to see the traces of spirit Numina as well as willworker magic, and gauge the strength of the local Gauntlet.

As a result, the orders don\u2019t have opinions about the Echo Walkers that could be considered a \u201cparty line.\u201d<div>The Echo Walkers, however, claim membership in all five of the orders.

Echo Walkers in the Free Council use the order\u2019s connections with new learning and techn\xe9 to try to find a scientific or at least modern understanding of the Ones Before.

Of course, the Guardians also tend to deal most harshly with the Blinded when they find them.</div>",appearance:"Echo Walkers are often healthy-looking and exuberant. This is partly a result of their studies of the Life Arcanum, but for the most part, their enthusiasm comes from their purposeful lives. An Echo Walker lives each day hoping to finally crack the final riddle and meet the Ones Before once again, and that notion fills her with joy and anticipation. Echo Walkers, despite their Left-Handed appellation, are some of the most positive and outgoing mages the Awakened could hope to meet, which is just one more reason that the Elect are so often overlooked.",background:"The Obrimos who chooses to become an Echo Walker was typically a devout practitioner of one faith or another before her Awakening. A good number of the Elect, though, pick up such faith after their visit to the Aether.<div>Whenever they received their calling, such mages feel that the Awakened are missing something. Perhaps the mages feel that the orders put too much stock in stories of Atlantis, or maybe they think that using magic for day-to-day needs is disrespectful. The common thread is that these Theurgists feel the pull of something greater than they, some long-lost birthright to their Path. That birthright, of course, is the wisdom and power of the Ones Before.</div><div>It would be tempting to say that mages who join this Legacy aren\u2019t very bright, or, at least, are weak-willed for placing their faith so blindly in such a legend. The truth, though, is that many Echo Walkers are intelligent, well educated and quite lucid. They simply believe in the Ones Before, and so their actions, however deplorable another mage might find them, are reasonable to the Elect. That\u2019s small consolation to the Sleepers whose souls the Blinded push out of joint for a bare glance at glory, of course.</div>",organizzation:"While the Echo Walkers certainly don\u2019t think of themselves as a Left-Handed Legacy, they do recognize that openly advertising their methods would be unwise.

The Legacy mimics a cult or a radical church in this respect. The Echo Walkers don\u2019t necessarily look down on other mages for not recognizing the Ones Before, but the Elect do see talking to such Awakened about magical matters as tedious and frustrating, because outsiders lack the \u201ccorrect\u201d frame of reference. There is no set proscription, though, that prevents Echo Walkers from joining orders or cabals. Thus, one of the Elect might be a high-ranking member of a Consilium without anyone except her tutor knowing it.</div>",suggestedOblations:"Studying ancient myths, evolutionary science or anything else that could contain information on the Ones Before.

There have always been mages on the Path of the Mighty, they say, who strive to bring the angels to the world \u2014 or, barring that, become those angels, to the extent that they can.</div><div>In fact, though, the Legacy\u2019s first known practitioner dates back to the mid-17th century, as the Puritans were crossing the Atlantic for religious freedom. One of those Puritans, a man that history remembers as Adam Goode, Awakened during the crossing. His account, written on fragments of paper and reassembled in later years, describes a conversation with the angels of the Aether and his subsequent \u201crealization\u201d of their true nature:</div><div><i>I came upon a great tower, so high that I could not see the top, so bright that it nearly blinded me. I drew in my breath and allowed the light of the Lord to fill me, and it lifted me up, and in a blink of an eye I stood upon the top of the Tower. And all about me were luminous angels. Some were winged and some carried swords, but some resembled great beasts, and still I knew them all as angels. And one said unto me, \u201cBehold, Adam Goode, for you have been chosen to look out upon the Kingdom of Celestial Spheres and know the world for what it is \u2014 Fallen.\u201d</i></div><div><i>And I said unto the angel, \u201cHave mercy upon me, for I am but man, consigned to the watery depths by the will of the Almighty,\u201d for I believed myself to have been flung into the sea by the storm. And the angel said, \u201cNo, Adam Goode, you have not perished, but are exalted, and stand here upon the Watchtower of the Golden Key to meet your destiny as one of the Mighty.\u201d And I knew then of the nature of the beings around me \u2014 not the angelic Host, but their children, scoured from the Earth in the Great Flood. I had been chosen to walk among them, to become one of the Mighty, and I knew that these beings were from Before. My voice died in my throat, but I made my mark in their great book, and before I could ask further questions or utter my thanks I was back on the ship, and all around me was thunder, lashing rain and fear. And I pointed to the sky and commanded the storm to cease, and as I was one of the Mighty, it did obey.\u201d</i></div><div>Adam Goode reached America, but by that time most of his fellow Puritans were dead or mad. Plague on such ships, of course, wasn\u2019t uncommon, but when these new settlers came ashore they told strange tales to the resident colonists. The newcomers spoke of Adam\u2019s sermons and the way he would lay his hand upon their foreheads, his fingers colder than death and yet searing at the same time. Many of those who had received \u201cAdam\u2019s Touch\u201d died in their sleep or jumped into the sea within a month or two, and even those who survived were haunted by terrible nightmares, malaise, paranoia and general ill health for the rest of their lives. Adam, for his part, opined that his touch was merely opening the recipient\u2019s soul to the glory of the Ones Before, and that Satan was attracted to those thus illuminated and caused their afflictions. This flimsy logic only held up for so long (particularly as mages among both the colonists and the native peoples saw the detrimental effects of Adam\u2019s magic), and Adam Goode was hanged in 1687 for witchcraft. He was suspected to have taken on apprentices, however, but they were never identified. The Echo Walker Legacy, then called the Covenant of the First Angels, had taken root.</div><div>Over the ensuing centuries, the Legacy spread out across the United States, and then the world. Many cultures and mythologies have stories about some primal race, sometimes sublime, sometimes bestial, and these tales were easily subsumed into the Legacy\u2019s beliefs. As the Legacy grew and encompassed other theories on the Ones Before, the Covenant of the First Angels became the Walkers in the Echoes of the First Voices, and later simply the Echo Walkers.</div><div>The Elect have adapted their theories with the times, and this is part of what makes them so dangerous \u2014 it\u2019s not accurate to classify them as religious fanatics, because some Echo Walkers are quite secular. It\u2019s not accurate to say that they believe in the Nephilim, or the Titans or any other mythological precursor to humans, because some Echo Walkers don\u2019t believe any such thing. And, while it is accurate to call them a Left-Handed Legacy, doing so is dangerous. Most mages think of the Scelesti or perhaps the Tremere liches when that term is applied, and such mages are often easy to identify with close scrutiny. But the Echo Walkers can be part of a Consilium or even a cabal for years before the nature of their magic becomes apparent.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>To the Echo Walkers, the human soul is a kind of living record. The human soul is a lens with which a perceptive mage can view the original \u201cblueprint\u201d of humanity \u2014 the Ones Before. Of course, motives for wishing to view this blueprint vary, as do the ultimate goals of the Echo Walkers, but the treatment of the soul in question is uniformly unpleasant. The Death 2/Prime 1 \u201cDislodge the Soul\u201d spell (see sidebar) is an integral part of the Legacy, and learning the Glimpse of Glory rote based upon it is often part of the induction into the Echo Walkers.</div><div>Other mages, however, don\u2019t normally know enough about the Echo Walkers to recognize them as a threat. These so-called Elect seem to be driven, zealous and perhaps a bit deluded, but ultimately their fanaticism is aimed at the Supernal Realms, not at serving the Abyss, stealing immortality or some other unpalatable prospect. Yes, individual Echo Walkers might be dangerous, but that danger is a function of their zeal, not their beliefs per se.</div><div>Those Awakened who know that the Echo Walkers not only seek to learn about the Ones Before, but do so by forcing Sleepers\u2019 souls out of alignment and peering into the gap between soul and consciousness, see the Legacy in the same light that most mages see the Wicked or the liches. The Echo Walkers are taught that they will, at some point, probably run into a mage who knows of the more unpleasant aspects of their quest. When confronted, the Echo Walkers are taught to make the magic seem, if not benign, then at least reversible. For whatever it\u2019s worth, a few Echo Walkers do learn the required Spirit magic to repair the damage done by their spells and make it a point to do so. Others use more mundane means of helping their victims, such as sponsoring free clinics to help people suffering from depression. These altruistic behaviors only last until the mage\u2019s Wisdom falls to the point that she simply doesn\u2019t care anymore. The Echo Walkers know, though, that most Consilii will not appreciate what the Elect are trying to accomplish, and the members of the Legacy are advised to have an escape plan ready.</div><div>Searching for the Ones Before Every Echo Walker has her own reasons for trying to find the truth about the angels of the Aether. Some of the Elect feel that the Ones Before have knowledge that would allow the Abyss to finally close and for mages to reveal themselves to a world that can finally understand them. Mages of a more religious bent might believe that living service to or emulation of the Ones Before is akin to a holy vow, but before the Echo Walkers can actually take this vow, they must learn what it entails.</div><div>Some Echo Walkers are in it for the sheer philosophical discovery \u2014 what are these Supernal beings, and how do they fit into humanity\u2019s destiny? Other Elect are simply power-hungry, and see the Ones Before as a source of potentially limitless magical prowess if the Echo Walkers can learn their secrets. Finally, some Elect theorize that the Ones Before might not be a more enlightened state of humanity, but instead might represent a less advanced version. If that is the case, then what did humanity gain by giving up the obvious glory and power of the Ones Before?</div><div>Many of these reasons are benign or even noble, or at least understandable, when the mage begins her journey. As Wisdom falls, though, the mage\u2019s quest tends to become obsessed with an image of the Ones Before. Her reasons for searching for them fall away, slowly but surely, replaced by a simplistic need to know about them. At this point, usually around Wisdom 4 or 5, the mage develops the Image of Perfection Merit (see sidebar). The mage has abandoned so much of her humanity that she would betray her order, cabal and even her closest friends and family if it meant learning even one tiny iota of information about the Ones Before.</div><h4  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>New Merit: Image of Perfection (\u2022\u2022\u2022)</h4><div><b>Prerequisite:</b> Echo Walker, Death 2</div><div>Effect: The Echo Walker has developed a goal for herself, an image of her own soul merged with the glory and might of the Ones Before. This image is her muse, her daimon and her constant guide, beckoning her on through any moments of doubt or uncertainty. She becomes unable to consider that any action taken in pursuit of this goal is immoral or harmful, no matter how others might be affected. Such Echo Walkers often have constructed reasons or excuses as to why this is the case, usually with some variation on the \u201cgreater good\u201d or the \u201cends justifying the means.\u201d What it boils down to, however, is that the mage\u2019s lust for power outweighs her morality.</div><div>This doesn\u2019t prevent the mage from losing Wisdom, of course, but does help in avoiding the insanity that comes with Wisdom loss. After gaining this Merit, whenever the Echo Walker loses a dot of Wisdom due to an act of Hubris, the player can spend a Willpower point to change the dice pool to avoid gaining a derangement to the character\u2019s Resolve + Composure rather than her new Wisdom rating. The character\u2019s Image of Perfection keeps her focused and, if not exactly sane, than at least functional. This serves to make Echo Walkers very dangerous, however, as they become true sociopaths given enough time.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Echo Walkers who wish to act as tutors to potential members have a delicate time ahead. A few Obrimos emerge from their Awakenings wanting to know the truth about the angels of Aether, but few are willing to base their magical practice on seeking out these beings, particularly if doing so means causing harm to others. Some Echo Walkers get around this by finding potential pupils before they Awaken, but there is no guarantee that a prospective mage will indeed Awaken at the Watchtower of the Golden Key, or find her way back from the Supernal Realms at all.</div><div>Tutors, therefore, spend a great deal of time feeling out prospective students before making any offers. The tutors take special interest in the Obrimos\u2019 experiences during her Awakening. After all, not every mage even visits the Supernal Realms in a direct fashion, and Obrimos who experienced mystery plays instead of \u201cnormal\u201d Awakenings (see p. 31 of Mage: The Awakening) aren\u2019t usually the kind of mage that the Elect invite aboard. If nothing else, an Echo Walker often tries to teach the prospective member the rudiments of the Death Arcana, since it is not only necessary for the Legacy\u2019s research but tends to be difficult for Obrimos to learn.</div><div>If a tutor successfully captures a student\u2019s interest in the Ones Before (by whatever name the student is comfortable using), the tutor slowly shows his student the \u201cevidence\u201d that the Legacy has collected on these beings. What form this evidence takes depends on the mage in question. Some have books of accounts, drawings and other primary sources about these figures, others use the Prime Arcanum to create illusions of them. At every turn, the tutor stresses that the Legacy doesn\u2019t know enough about the Ones Before to make a definitive judgment about their nature or on the concrete benefit of unlocking their secrets. One might expect this admission of ignorance to turn prospective members away, but mages are generally curious and often a little arrogant. Where other Awakened have failed, perhaps this new pupil might succeed? How much glory would an Obrimos who uncovered the secrets of the angels of the Aether receive?</div><div>Adding credence to the tutor\u2019s words is the fact that he truly believes what he is saying. The Echo Walkers don\u2019t have a sinister agenda (it\u2019s their methods that are sinister), and so even the most paranoid mage won\u2019t find traps or lies waiting for her in the Legacy. The Echo Walkers promise the potential of glory, knowledge and power, and they mean to deliver exactly that.</div><div>The First Step When an Obrimos agrees to join the Echo Walkers, the first thing she must be taught is the Glimpse of Glory rote (see above). This, of course, often requires making her an Apprentice of Death, since the Death Arcanum is difficult for the Theurgists to learn. Many nascent Elect wonder if perhaps there might be a better way to go about learning about the Ones Before. The Echo Walkers are happy to try any method that a pupil can think of, but the fact is that Death is the only Arcanum suitable for manipulating the human soul. Time can\u2019t reach far enough back to glimpse the world before the Fall, and Spirit can\u2019t take a mage back to the Aether. The Echo Walkers lament that studying Death is the only way to reach their goal, but so be it.</div><div>Once the pupil has learned this rote (by which time she has normally practiced it enough for her Wisdom rating to drop a bit), the tutor begins teaching her the Life Arcanum in preparation for the first Attainment. During this time, the pupil is expected to refrain from conducting \u201cresearch\u201d into the Ones Before (that is, dislodging souls) without the tutor\u2019s presence. This is partially to avoid notice from other mages, but mostly because the Echo Walkers don\u2019t want someone who is not a member of their Legacy to gain insight into the Ones Before that they don\u2019t possess.</div><div>Once the mage has made enough progress in her magical studies (which is a matter for the tutor to decide), the tutor and the pupil begin the soul-forging process. Joining the Echo Walkers shows the mage what Sleepers feel when their souls are dislodged, as the tutor uses the Death 4 variant of the \u201cDislodge the Soul\u201d spell on the pupil in order to begin the process (mechanically, this spell is identical to Dislodge the Soul, though the pupil submits willingly). Of course, when the process is complete, the mage is whole again, and therefore any sympathy with Sleepers doesn\u2019t tend to last.</div><div>The Second Step Some mages leave their tutors after achieving the first Attainment, having learned firsthand what their Sleeper victims go through. These mages are still Echo Walkers, but refuse to progress any further in the Legacy because doing so involves harming others. These laudable mages are tolerated so long as they keep quiet about the Legacy\u2019s methods \u2014 which, of course, few of them do. Destroying their pupils pains the Echo Walkers, but they feel that doing so is preferable to having the Awakened community as a whole lump the Elect in with the Scelesti, the liches and their Left-Handed ilk.</div><div>Mages who stay with their tutors are encouraged to gather as much data as they can. What follows is a spree of soul dislodging that usually leaves the mage with a precipitous drop in Wisdom, along with a number of dead or mad Sleepers in her wake. Many Echo Walkers believe that they gain better results when using the \u201cDislodge the Soul\u201d spell on a certain type of Sleeper, but this is simply a way for the mage to subconsciously feel better about the harm she is inflicting. A racist white mage might decide that she can see the Ones Before more clearly when looking through the souls of African Americans (and, in the process, believe that she\u2019s not racist at all, since she recognizes that black people clearly have a strong connection to the Ones Before). Any bias or prejudice can appear here, and Echo Walkers often developed elaborate theories as to why a given type of person produces a clearer picture.</div><div>Once the mage has accumulated a good body of data on the Ones Before, she presents her findings to her tutor. This presentation can take the form of a thesis, a lecture or any other medium that the tutor finds appropriate. If the pupil\u2019s presentation meets the tutor\u2019s approval, he declares her worthy of progressing in the Legacy and the pupil reshapes her soul once again.</div><div>The Third Step Few Echo Walkers reach the third Attainment, but it\u2019s not for lack of trying. Once the mage has presented her findings on the Ones Before to her tutor (and thus achieved the second Attainment), she has become one of the Legacy\u2019s up-and-coming researchers. She is then expected to be extremely selective in her choices of Sleepers to \u201cstudy,\u201d choosing only those who have something to contribute. How this is determined, of course, depends very much on that mage\u2019s research. Normally, the mage examines a prospective Sleeper carefully, often using such spells as Death 1 \u201cSoul Marks,\u201d for whatever trait she finds important, before dislodging the Sleeper\u2019s soul.</div><div>Since the mage is establishing a pattern, though, she is also making it easier for others to track her. Upon reaching the second Attainment, Echo Walkers are warned that if they are captured or questioned, they must not betray the Legacy, lest all of the research of the Elect be lost. Echo Walkers, therefore, often fight to the death if confronted, though more clever ones make use of spells such as Mind 2 \u201cMemory Hole.\u201d</div><div>Most Echo Walkers develop the Image of Perfection Merit (see p. 125) during this period, fixating on their ideal picture of the Ones Before. If an Echo Walker manages to build up a convincing picture and theory of what these beings truly are before she becomes irrevocably insane or is hunted down by other mages, her tutor allows her to make her presentation to a council composed of three Echo Walkers who have achieved the third Attainment. This presentation takes the form of an interview or thesis defense, with the more advanced members grilling the pupil on her theory, its applications and any supporting evidence. A Sleeper is almost always presented as part of this evidence. The elder Echo Walkers dislodge the unfortunate\u2019s soul and examine the \u201cdata,\u201d usually with someone on hand who can reattach the soul so as to facilitate repeated viewings. (This punishment is very often fatal for the Sleeper, but the mages present have typically long since passed the point of concern.)</div><div>The actual merit of the data presented at this council is probably negligible. The mages have become so blind, and usually mad, by this point that their delusions simply feed into one another. However, an Echo Walker who can remain functional long enough to reach this point is rewarded with the third Attainment. After that, she continues her research, normally picking up a pupil of her own not long after.</div><div>Note, of course, that an Echo Walker can actually achieve the third Attainment on her own without submitting to the examinations of the council. The pupil isn\u2019t told this piece of information, however. If she figures it out on her own, the more learned members of the Legacy congratulate her on her ingenuity \u2014 and keep very close tabs on this most clever of the Elect from then on.</div>",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"The Attainments of the Echo Walkers focus on regaining the power and glory of the Ones Before.

The Elect\u2019s own frail bodies cannot approach this sort of glory, but with the second Attainment of this Legacy, the Echo Walkers can at least start down the right path. Similar to the Life 3 \u201cHoning the Form\u201d spell, the Form of the Nephilim Attainment allows the mage to increase her Physical Attributes. Sadly, this increase is temporary. The meat of the Fallen World does not hold on to the power of the Supernal easily, not with the Abyss constantly sucking the power away.</div><div>To activate this Attainment, the mage merely concentrates for a few seconds and wills her body to take on the strength and nobility of her spiritual forerunners. The player spends one point of Mana. She can then add a number of dots equal to the character\u2019s Life Arcanum into one of the mage\u2019s Physical Attributes. This allocation can be different each time the Attainment is used. For instance, a mage with Life 3 might choose to add the points to Strength if she is anticipating a fistfight. If she needs fine motor control or precise handling of an object, she might instead allocate them to Dexterity.</div><div>This Attainment can boost Attributes over the maximum normally allowed by the character\u2019s Gnosis. Any increases to these Attributes also affect derived traits such as Speed and Health (see \u201cTemporary Health Dots\u201d on p. 173 of the World of Darkness Rulebook).</div><div>Echo Walkers often become more attractive when using this Attainment. The change isn\u2019t enough to stop people who know the Elect from recognizing them, or to grant bonuses to Social rolls (as the Striking Looks Merit would), but is simply reflective of their overall bearing. They carry themselves with confidence and power, as though they were channeling the Ones Before.</div>",secondAttainmentOptArcana:"Prime 3",secondAttainmentOptDescrizione:"<div>While the physical prowess that this Attainment brings is often a good enough reason for using it, the Echo Walkers sometimes need to demonstrate their power and enlightenment to doubting mages (or even to Sleepers). If the mage also knows Prime 3, she can create a magical halo around her, and even add wings, weapons or any other features she believes that the Ones Before might have possessed. This effect is similar to the Prime 3 \u201cPhantasm\u201d spell, save that the illusion is centered around the mage herself and does not cost Mana. The illusion can make the Echo Walker look either angelically beautiful or horrifically ugly, but cannot make her appear nondescript or be used to disguise her. Calling upon the Form of the Nephilim in this manner is meant to awe or terrify her audience.</div><div>Aside from any bonuses to Intimidation or Persuasion rolls that this use of the Attainment might grant, calling upon the illusion also changes the Echo Walker\u2019s personal resonance somewhat.

This, in many legends, is what forced these elder beings into exile or called down their destruction from their enemies or creator, but the Echo Walkers feel that since humans are predisposed toward certain instinctual reactions, there is no harm in making use of them. By triggering deepseated biological programming, the Echo Walkers can nudge others to take certain actions.</div><div>This Attainment works similarly to the Life 4 \u201cTrigger the Lizard Brain\u201d spell (see p. 191 of Mage: The Awakening), but affords the mage a slightly greater range of responses she can evoke. The player rolls Presence + Medicine + Life in a contested roll against the target\u2019s Resolve + Gnosis. If the Echo Walker wins, she may evoke any instinctual response that the target is capable of \u2014 mindless rage, abject fear, the urge to mate and so on. Because the part of the brain being triggered is so closely linked with memory and learning, however, the mage may choose to manipulate the target\u2019s mind more subtly. This changes the roll to Manipulation + Medicine + Life (still contested in the same way). If the roll is successful, the target is unable to process any new memories for the duration of the scene. His brain simply does not convert the information from short-term to long-term memory. This means that no matter what the Echo Walker does to the target during the next hour or so, he won\u2019t remember it, and no magic based on retrieving the memory allows him to (since it simply isn\u2019t present in his brain). Magic or supernatural powers based on psychometry or postcognition, of course, reveal what happened in that area and thus can show a viewer what the Echo Walker did or learned.</div><div>Obviously, use of this Attainment can very easily require a degeneration roll, depending on what use the mage puts the Attainment.</div>",thirdAttainmentOptArcana:"Prime 4",thirdAttainmentOptDescrizione:"Echo Walkers with the appropriate magical expertise can extend this Attainment\u2019s \u201cdivine right\u201d to magic.

This knowledge is what gives them their power.</div><div>There are other ways to use the power of secrets. To destroy a secret is a final act, one that can never be repaired or repealed. Some mages learn how to eradicate knowledge, ensuring that it can never be recovered. These mages\u2019 souls absorb and consume secrets, dissolving them as an amoeba devours its nutrients, and with the same result. Complete destruction of unshared knowledge, perfect in its privacy, gifts such a mage with strength and power that she could not otherwise possess. This is an unacceptable habit by the standards of most mages.</div><div>Secrets are the lifeblood of Supernal power. Even the smallest secret might be the key that unlocks the next portal into the Mysteries. The words of a long-dead Adamantine Arrow might be the last clue necessary for a contemporary master of Forces to reach archmastery. Secrets might lead members of the Mysterium to a lost temple from the time of Atlantis.</div><div>Knowledge is what mages need, and destroying it is anathema to them. Keeping secrets close, hiding them, parceling them out to only the worthy and righteous, these are all par for the course. But to consume knowledge, losing it forever, is what makes the Logophages \u2014 or Secret Keepers, as they call themselves \u2014 a Left-Landed Legacy.</div><div>Most important is what binds the members of this Legacy to one another: keeping secrets. All the Logophage does is in the service of keeping the secrets from falling into the wrong hands. There are so many mages in the Fallen World who belong there, who are fallen, too, and would not properly use the knowledge available to them. Sleepers would not understand what they learned even as their attention tarnished it. In order to prevent the misuse of the Arcana, and to prevent the Mysteries from unraveling beneath the Sleepers\u2019 collective gaze, Logophages put secrets where none will ever see them. A mage truly worthy to wield knowledge that a Secret Keeper has hidden will find a way, they believe. They destroy understanding in order to save it, and it is the nobility of their quest that empowers them \u2014 not some obscene exchange of truth for might.</div>",alternateNickname:"Secret Keepers (their own name for themselves), Logophages (other mages\u2019 name for the Legacy)",orders:"All of the orders desire more clues to the Mysteries. Keys to understanding are the blood in their veins and the currency that trades hands. In that light, it\u2019s no surprise that the rumors of this Legacy bring out anger in all of them, the rage that they often can\u2019t direct at the distant Exarchs. When the Logophages come up in discussion, the conversation inevitably turns dark, often murderously so. Pentacle mages consider the Logophages to be doing the next best thing to working for the Exarchs directly. Logophages do as much, some claim, as the Seers of the Throne toward suppressing the world\u2019s magic and mages. But no order is as vocal as the Mysterium. Mystagogues endlessly rummage through the lost corners of the world, and so often their progress depends on the missing word of a riddle or the faded portion of a map. To them, the habits of the Logophages are nothing short of sabotage and treason.<div>Conversely, the Guardians of the Veil are, if not agreeable, more sympathetic with the concept of a Logophage. Few actively want to destroy knowledge not known, but rare is the Guardian who hasn\u2019t felt the simple (and flawed) urge to destroy material rather than hide it. It is safe, if not wise, and some extreme Guardians of the Veil leave behind the \u201cillusion\u201d that they steal and hide secrets not for their power, but for others\u2019 Wisdom. Despite this sympathy, Guardians are aware that more whispers connect the Logophages to their order than others, and occasionally make an effort to root followers of the Legacy out of their ranks.</div>",appearance:"Because Secret Keepers are members of a Left-Handed Legacy, they need to blend in. In general, a Logophage looks just like a mage trying to look like a Sleeper. Some Logophages develop slight tells in their personalities. They eavesdrop and spy almost habitually, though they are relatively subtle about it, because even mundane secrets are secrets to be used.",background:"As noted above, Guardians of the Veil who begin to obsess about keeping dangerous secrets hidden may step over the edge into this Legacy. Such a mage might begin by worrying overmuch about the security of certain knowledge, then develop that concern into a full-blown paranoia by keeping secrets only to himself. Others cannot be trusted to prevent them from falling into unworthy hands. From there, it is only a small advance into the territory of the Logophage \u2014 consuming the clues is the only way to keep them forever safe, especially in a world where one\u2019s foes can read one\u2019s mind. The power that results from the Logophage\u2019s meal of secrets is simply the strength of righteousness.<div>This \u201cmadness\u201d can come upon any mage, as every member of the Awakened world quickly learns the importance of concealing the truths of the Fallen World from its Sleeping inhabitants. Such knowledge should also be kept from many other mages, because only few deserve that understanding. Some, for example, the Guardians, begin to take the matter too far. It becomes clear to them that there are none worthy, and that they should, therefore, destroy the knowledge, or they delude themselves into thinking that the hiding is more important than measured sharing. They then seek to become, as a Logophage, the best of hiding places.</div>",organizzation:"The ties that bind Logophages to one another are very, very loose but very, very secure. Tutors of this Legacy meet their students the way fanatics of any sort do \u2014 by sounding out each others\u2019 ideologies and finding the agreement that they need. The process is careful and exacting, not proof against betrayal but functional enough that the Logophages have survived since ancient times.<div>After a certain amount of instruction, the master and student separate, because their security best lies in distance. This bond and the identity of one\u2019s pupil is the one thing that no Logophage can ever forget, secret though it may be. Occasionally, one will contact the other \u2014 they share recent goals reached (but never sought). Sharing what secrets they have successfully protected from danger is impossible, but they can occasionally describe what sort of understanding they have \u201csaved.\u201d</div><div>In rare instances, one knows of a threatening secret that is soon to be uncovered or that is unsecure and in danger of being disseminated beyond one\u2019s ability to consume it. That one might request that a teacher or student recover the secret first and guard it from undesired discovery.</div><div>Beyond the student-teacher bond that the Secret Keepers keep forever, the amount of organized communication between followers of this Legacy borders on none. Each and every Logophage understands that other mages do not recognize the nobility of the Logophages\u2019 efforts. To be too open, or too lax in protecting themselves, would shortly result in the destruction of their already limited brotherhood. In the pursuit of security, a Logophage routinely purges himself of any knowledge of his contacts. This practice helps prevent other Awakened investigators from rifling through the mage\u2019s mind and learning enough to devastate the Legacy\u2019s goals. That burning the knowledge gives the Logophage a small burst of power is merely an attractive by-product; to the Secret Keepers, it is a reward for good duty.</div><div>Not knowing any other Secret Keepers beyond one\u2019s tutor and students has a price. When a Logophage needs trustworthy help, he rarely has more than one or two mages whom he believes can \u201csafely\u201d observe something secret. They may not be available. He needs to depend on mages whom he can manipulate, and he must force them into a situation in which he can control the flow of information. If necessary, he won\u2019t hesitate to tear their memories apart after he no longer needs them. Such acts threaten to endanger the Logophage\u2019s overall mission but are sometimes necessary.</div><div>Two Secret Keepers sometimes meet through happenstance. Each may be sounding out the other as a potential candidate for induction, only to discover that they are already allies in their war to defend the Mysteries. Such meetings are occasionally fortuitous, occurring when one Logophage or the other needs confidential assistance. Most of the time, the two mages simply \u201cforget\u201d about one another (via their first Attainment) as soon as is convenient. The Legacy survives through secrecy.</div>",suggestedOblations:"Destroying sources of knowledge (stealing and burning old or rare books from a library or silencing an informant).

So they chose to forget their foundation, protecting it as they do all important secrets. As far as anyone knowing the truth, that was the end of that. Not all Logophages, or other mages, for that matter, are willing to leave it at that.</div><div>The histories that mages can find are too varied to be worth too much. Only a rough estimate of timing pervades all the myths: they all agree that the first Secret Keepers formed during the time of troubles following Atlantis\u2019 Fall. Here are a few beliefs that some Logophages may hold, or that the mages who research them may uncover.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Consequence of Sin</h3><div>The unintentional father of the Legacy, the mage known as Oholibamah, lived in the period following the Fall. In his folly, others found inspiration. A small cabal of Logophages reconstructed the events after the fact. Oholibamah seemed to have been working with a group of other mages while seeking to protect and hide away their lore for an age when civilization might rise again. In the process of concealing the resting place of their Artifacts and grimoires, a petty argument led Oholibamah to kill one of his companions in a rage. Then, fearing justice for his action, he slew the rest of the group to keep his sin a secret.</div><div>This is not unique. People kill out of rage and fear every day. What is remarkable is that Oholibamah refused to lose the knowledge the group had journeyed to hide away. During each murder after the first, which was out of passion, Oholibamah took from his companions\u2019 minds all they knew of the Mysteries. He could not comprehend it all, so he compartmentalized it within his memory.</div><div>When Oholibamah was eventually found, he was half-mad from his own conscience and his fraying compartmentalization. Studying his mind and soul, his saviors found a remarkable interaction between the two; examination revealed the first secrets of the Legacy. Despite his sins, he had endeavored to protect knowledge. Oholibamah\u2019s first \u201cstudents\u201d executed him to make his unintended success complete, then dedicated themselves to being as excellent secret keepers as Oholibamah had been, through his actions and in his death.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>History That Was Not</h3><div>Living in the cold lands in the north, Munin saw how mages interacted: wary, full of distrust, they rarely became friends and every treaty between their groupings required lengthy politicking. They warred over small slights, eager to use their dangerous spells and tools to claim supremacy and spoils. There was no order, no larger organization that bound mages to each other, nothing to prevent the endless self-attrition and nothing to encourage them to greater things. Despairing, Munin sought a miracle.</div><div>Working a great spell aided by her apprentices and bound demons, the great mage created a false past. She invented an island where mages had once ruled, where they had belonged to orders and worked in concert. To make it an attractive belief, she made it a time of ideal magic, free of Paradoxes and with plentiful Mana. She created enemies, usurping gods of the Supernal Realms, to give mages a shared purpose. And mages across the world remembered something greater. They began to share purpose and fear, and in so doing they discovered their potential for greatness. Munin swore her apprentices to secrecy and went to her grave without telling another soul. The apprentices went on to found the Secret Keepers.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Necessity of Cain</h3><div>There were twin brothers once, both mages, identical in every way but that one walked the Path of the Moros and the other the Acanthus. Together, the two brothers came upon something so horrific that both agreed it could never be shared or seen again. Some modern Logophages name it Abyssal, others a fiendish scheme of the Exarchs or the Oracles\u2019 Achilles heel, but none of them know. Here is why they don\u2019t know. No fools these brothers, they knew that someday, somebody would have the secret out of them. That was unthinkable. Together, they sought a way to kill their knowledge so that it might be safe. Between one brother\u2019s mastery of Death and the other\u2019s insight into Fate, they discovered an answer. So it came to pass that the Moros killed his brother, weeping all the while, in a ritual to slay his own memory. In so doing, he saved the world from his terrible knowledge. Instead of remembering what could devastate the world, he remembered only murdering his brother. He was the first Secret Keeper, and to honor his brother\u2019s memory he passed on the Legacy and the responsibility that comes with it.</div><div>As the legend\u2019s name suggests, some Logophages who believe this origin story consider it the foundation of the Bible\u2019s story of Cain and Abel. Studying History It\u2019s not easy to study history at the source, rather than from books. Pages can be reprinted; the actual places where history happened have withered, weathered hundreds or thousands of years, suffered decay, been torn down and rebuilt. Truth is hard to find amidst all the confusion.</div><div>The task only gets harder when people deliberately destroy written knowledge of the event. And when magic ensures that no one remembers it, there are no witnesses, or people who can write new records to replace those lost. Some societies that wipe out written accounts replace them with their own, or keep some form of the truth encrypted with their personal codes, but the Logophages are far too paranoid to believe that\u2019s a secure option. They are very complete when it comes to hiding something, reducing evidence it ever existed to unidentifiable tatters and then forgetting that they ever hid it.</div><div>So, since mages can\u2019t look at what remains to figure out the Secret Keepers\u2019 histories, the mages look at what\u2019s missing. Patterns surround suppression, and those who hunt what the Logophages hide \u2014 their Legacy\u2019s origins or valuable secrets \u2014 examine what isn\u2019t there. For instance, when the Winnebago tribe\u2019s trickster cycles explain several natural phenomena and cultural practices but ignore certain others, ones that other Native American myths cover, it is a clue. Perhaps that legend was embedded by a mage as a lesson to later shamans or seekers, and it is gone because a Logophage deemed it dangerous and consumed it. Records from the Tang Dynasty mention several thousand magisterial judgments; the fact that none can be found concerning accusations and punishment of charlatan magicians or Taoist alchemists is strange.</div><div>Secret Keepers work very hard to keep what secrets they deem important. They clear away as much of a trail as possible, altering memories and eliminating records. Even the Logophages admit that it\u2019s impossible to get rid of everything; they can only do as much as possible and hope it\u2019s enough.</div><div>Occasionally, a member of this Legacy becomes obsessed (more so than usual) with concealing a specific secret. That person proceeds to attempt to destroy knowledge in ever-widening circles around the secret, never satisfied with its security; he ends up only drawing more attention to it. Secret Keepers consider this something of a sickness. If they refer to it at all, they call it by the simple term: \u201cmania.\u201d</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Society and Culture</h2><div>In general, Logophages blend in with their Awakened brethren, participating in their orders\u2019 and Consilii\u2019s activities. While Logophages are not pleased with what they perceive as others\u2019 lax attitude toward sharing secrets only among the worthy, Logophages understand that most mages cannot be as dedicated as they. It is a failing they expect of those outside their Legacy.</div><div>A particularly great number of Secret Keepers belong to the Mysterium and the Guardians of the Veil. The former because mystagogues actively seek out ancient knowledge, and being the inside man on such an expedition is one of the most advantageous positions for a Logophage. Logophages occupy the latter because the Guardians\u2019 goals are most similar to the Logophages\u2019 obsessions. Not only do more Secret Keepers recruit from the Guardians of the Veil (and more successfully), but doing so offers a similar advantage when the Guardians steal secret and powerful knowledge from other sources. When a mage\u2019s companions or acquaintances discover that she is a Secret Keeper, she typically neither flees nor fights unless forced to do either. She explains. All but the most extreme Logophages have very rational reasons for believing that they must protect knowledge the way they do. This attempt is often more effective than mages would expect. Few outside the Legacy really know the Secret Keepers\u2019 true aims, considering them nothing more than thieves and destroyers, and learning a Logophage\u2019s perspective sometimes moves her captors. If other mages still do not see the necessity of her mission, so be it; if they were likely to, they might already be Secret Keepers. Some exposed Logophages continue to proselytize throughout their subsequent capture and interrogation, secure in the belief that no one will learn how to find others of her Legacy from her. Others simply flee to a new area, taking a new name and integrating themselves once again into Awakened society.</div><div>Secret Keepers don\u2019t have much of a social structure internal to the Legacy. They are, as one would suspect, very secretive. Quite on purpose, the only bonds a Logophage retains within the Legacy are with his tutor and his students. Even those, he breaks after he or his students attain the third Attainment. Any meetings with other Secret Keepers, usually arranged through tutors or students, are very important secrets to be kept \u2014 and Logophages keep them the best way they know how. They don\u2019t come together often, or for anything less than a piece of knowledge they consider pivotal, but once they go their separate ways the Logophages rarely remember their companions. Or the mission, for that matter.</div><div>Members of the Legacy consider themselves protectors of the Fallen World and the Supernal Realms. They guard, in order of importance, the world from the misuse of magic, the Ars Mysteriorum from the attention of the unworthy, and the safety of their Legacy. As important a job as the Secret Keepers are doing, every one of them joined the Legacy out of personal responsibility to the world; they would be remiss to place themselves above their duty.</div><div>Some have trouble believing that they have the wisdom necessary to destroy knowledge: if they are not worthy enough to master a Mystery, how can they be worthy enough to destroy that Mystery? Logophages who suffer this uncertainty may restrict themselves to eliminating secrets of lesser import (but also lesser danger) until they grow more confident (and hubristic, other mages would say). Another Secret Keeper might correspond with her tutor, using her teacher\u2019s wisdom as a guideline until she feels capable of doing it herself.</div><div>Less rarely than Logophages would like, one of their number goes \u201crogue.\u201d Similar to those afflicted with the mania, these renegades are dangerous and must be stopped. But instead of growing obsessed over the Legacy\u2019s core mission, a rogue Secret Keeper has become disaffected. He sees through the lies they tell themselves \u2014 that what they do is for the good of the Awakened, that the information will one day be recovered \u2014 and doesn\u2019t care. Enjoying the taste of knowledge and the feeling of power that burning it produces, the rogue acts as a Logophage for his own benefit. Other members of the Legacy hunt down rogues with great prejudice \u2014 although Logophages often have as much trouble tracking the rogues as other mages do.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Logophages are very, very cautious about whom they let into their little club. The Secret Keepers must be wary of those mages who do not understand the Legacy\u2019s dedication, and would destroy them. Even beyond that, allowing mages without the ideal moral character and devotion to serve such a grand cause would be folly; should the weak join them and then falter, it could begin a domino effect that would decimate their frail teacher-student networks, perhaps completely dooming their self-appointed mission.</div><div>As noted earlier, a Logophage finds potential pupils by sounding them out on the subject of protecting the Mysteries from Sleepers and unworthy mages. Few potential pupils possess the temperament and principles necessary to \u201cpass,\u201d and those who do must be shaped before they can become true Secret Keepers.</div><div>The tutor, having found a prospective recipient for his Legacy, must now test her. Between philosophical discussions on the nature of the Mysteries and their misapplication, the Logophage arranges for the student to encounter examples of magic misused. If he can show her a demonstration (not his own, surely) of a terrible Paradox or a spell that has harmed the secrecy of the Invisible World, that is ideal. Anything that makes her more concerned about into whose hands the Mysteries fall is a good lesson. When the master can arrange it, the lessons increase in severity and preventability. Pointing directly at a recently discovered secret as the cause of a disaster is about as perfect an example as the mentor could want.</div><div>Once the Secret Keeper decides the student is ready, he begins the test. He gives his student a secret, one both know is worth keeping. It is not, of course, of paramount importance, but it is nothing that should just be thrown away, either. The student receives the knowledge in some form that requires a personal sacrifice for her to protect the secret through destruction. One master might circle certain letters on certain pages of a student\u2019s heirloom book, another might tattoo clues on the student\u2019s back. Something must threaten to expose the knowledge to complete the test. Sometimes this happens naturally, as others ask to borrow the book or the student takes a lover who might see her back; if not, the tutor arranges it \u2014 spreading rumors about so-and-so\u2019s hidden magic generally does the trick.</div><div>There is only one real way to pass the test. Knowing that, a Secret Keeper chooses his methods based on his personal belief of how difficult the test should be. It\u2019s one thing to shed a tear and burn the Torah your grandfather used at his bar mitzvah; it\u2019s something else to take a power sander to your own back because anyone who helped you would see the writing. Because of the danger of being a Logophage, more masters of the Legacy tend toward more severe tests of devotion. Unusual scarring or wounds are not uncommon among Secret Keepers, though hardly a tell. Passing this test makes the mage a Proselyte. Logophages rarely use the term in this context, since they speak with other Secret Keepers almost not at all, but they use the title enough with their apprentices to pass it on. Proselyte refers to any inductee to the Legacy, from one who is trusted but without enough Gnosis for the first Attainment to one who has not yet achieved the second Attainment.</div><div>Realizing the Legacy\u2019s first Attainment requires the student to use it. This is not paradoxical, but more sacrifice. As the dedicated pupil feels the shape her soul is taking, it is still not fully formed. Her first step on the road of the Secret Keeper (or down the cursed path of the Logophage, some might say) is to consume one her own secret memories. It must be something powerful, something she loves. The memory of a very personal joy is perfect, but a person may love her hate or misery; forgetting the moment that caused her to swear an unexpressed revenge or the unshared childhood event that drove the rest of her life is just as valid. She is dropping her baggage so that she may advance along her chosen path. This act, the student vandalizing her own memory and shaking the seat of her current personality, locks her into the Legacy in one soul-stirring moment.</div><div>A character may be so very open and expressive that she has no truly secret memories. Such a character probably does not understand keeping things hidden from others well enough to have advanced to the status of Proselyte.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Advancement</h3><div>Once a student possesses the Legacy\u2019s first Attainment, the tutor and pupil typically go separate ways. One, usually the student (as the tutor is a higher-ranked Secret Keeper), may leave for another Consilium, often one a goodly distance away. Most ask other members of their order or Path for the Awakened equivalent of a letter of recommendation \u2014 at least a contact in the new area, since it\u2019s very hard to become trusted as an unknown mage. Those who are more confident in their ability to dissemble, or just like taking risks, may play themselves off as new mages and hope to be recruited into an order. Passing induction into whatever order already recruited them once isn\u2019t that hard \u2014 for a skilled liar, anyway.</div><div>Some Logophages resist their students\u2019 inclinations to sever the tutor-pupil link to develop the later Attainments on their own. The Legacy, they claim, has already benefited from centuries of development in that vein; already optimal for the Secret Keepers\u2019 purpose and concealment, to change it is dangerous. And the tithe of power doesn\u2019t hurt. Others consider the possibility that a student might be discovered and forced to give up the identity of the only Logophages he cannot forget his tutor  and pupils \u2014 a frightening weakness. These teachers encourage their apprentices to strike out on their own, believing improved safety worth the price of an imperfectly shaped soul.</div><div>For those who keep the bond in place, the teacher and pupil meet occasionally. They communicate securely if possible, but not with such heavy security that onlookers would attribute it to anything more than reasonable (for a mage) paranoia. Essentially, they appear to be old friends who occasionally get together for chats. They chat, however, about the form of a soul and how to perfectly eliminate knowledge, instead of local political gaffes and the weather.</div><div>Reaching the second Attainment requires further commitment, another sacrifice. Where releasing one\u2019s past makes the apprentice free to step forward, the next step requires her to clear the path ahead. In order to advance, the student must feed one of her secret ambitions or desires to her soul\u2019s fire. The only goals not valid for this sacrifice are those of the Secret Keepers. Anything else, from the untold desire to become Hierarch or the burning need to kill a mage who slighted her, is an effective choice. Clearing the knowledge from her mind, the mage removes one urge that could tempt her from the path of righteous defense of the Mysteries. From this point on, the mage graduates from Proselyte to Secret Keeper. Others who recognize the character\u2019s level of advancement generally accord her respect for being a full member of the Legacy, though a little disdain or distrust for those younger or less advanced is not unusual.</div><div>When the pupil is ready for the third Attainment, to become a pupil no more, the act of forgetting who once taught her lets her attain it. Her teacher\u2019s tutelage helps her reach the position of understanding from where she can take that step, but once she does, she does not know him any longer. Everything she once knew about the person who guided her is gone, and she is a master Logophage in her own right. Logophages who diverge from the core Legacy may develop separate sacrifices, or other actions necessary for advancement within the Legacy.</div>",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"The Attainments of the Secret Keepers allow the Legacy\u2019s dedicated members to destroy knowledge as effectively as possible. Books may be burnt, computer records destroyed and ancient Artifacts buried under the ocean, but human knowledge is hard to fully annihilate.

More than simply concealing knowledge, the Logophage can wipe it completely from his mind. His mind consumes the memory so well he can never recall it.

Great orators like Pericles of Athens made speeches that touched the depths of their listeners\u2019 hearts and spirits. However, not all amazing orators were great political leaders; some were inveterate con artists like Cagliostro, or figures of mystery such as the Comte St. Germain. The ability to lie convincingly and to convince others that the speaker is both truthful and worth listening to is not uncommon among Sleepers; truly great orators, however, who can convince people to change long-held opinions or cause those they speak with to trust their own senses less than the speaker\u2019s works are rare indeed.</div><div>For many, the attainment of such verbal excellence is too difficult and subtle a path to power. Most people find the more obvious language of violence, threats and bribes to be easier, as well as exceedingly powerful and effective. However, even the most dire threat or the most tempting bribe only serves to control the subject\u2019s actions \u2014 in their hearts, they still know and understand that they are being coerced and may someday learn to resist fear or temptation and disobey the person offering the threats or bribes.</div><div>Threats of disobedience soon start a vicious cycle, in which the individual who wishes to remain in charge must continually offer ever more extravagant threats or bribes, or sometimes both together, to make certain that their subjects continue to obey them. Realizing the difficulty and the ultimate futility of such endeavors, some would-be rulers seek to find ways to convince their subjects to follow them willingly and to accept the ruler\u2019s pronouncements as the ultimate truth. Long ago, Machiavelli said that it is better to be feared than loved, because love is more ephemeral, but wise rulers, as well as skilled con artists, advertising agents and some mages understand that being trusted and believed is best of all.</div><div>Whether Sleeper or mage, the path to gaining a listener\u2019s trust is similar \u2013 the speaker must understand the secret language hidden in every person\u2019s unconscious. This language of pupil dilation, posture, stance, vocal tone and many similar cues is exceedingly subtle and difficult to master, but the rewards are correspondingly great. While mortals who master these methods can become great orators and equally impressively liars, mages who pursue this Legacy can become greater still. Legends speak of a Bearer of the Eternal Voice being found at a murder scene clutching a bloody knife in his hand, but who was released solely based upon his account of the events leading up to his discovery with the knife.</div><div>In the ancient streets of Atlantis, the Bearers of the Eternal Voice walked among the populace, reassuring them about the wisdom of their rulers and convincing them of the urgent necessity of opposing the enemies of Atlantis. In this longlost era, the Bearers of the Eternal Voice also went in secret to other nations, convincing both leaders and important members of the populace of the folly of opposing Atlantis and of the great benefits that would swiftly follow an alliance with this great power.</div><div>Since the Fall, those who study this Legacy are often called Whisperers, because of the hidden and secretive role they must now play.

However, Whisperers do their best to convince Sleepers that the most obvious damaging evidence for vulgar magic has some completely natural and reasonable explanation. Because Whisperers\u2019 abilities can also be used against other mages, especially mages less skilled in the Mind Arcanum, Whisperers are a somewhat secretive and insular group. This tendency is further exacerbated by the fact that their ability to manipulate others gives many Whisperers, particularly those who follow the Mastigos Path, a sense that everyone else is nothing more than will-less pawns whom Whisperers can manipulate as they will. This sense of superiority influences many Whisperers\u2019 dealings with Sleepers and sometimes carries over to their dealings with other mages. This same feeling also produces the intrinsic paradox that all Bearers of the Eternal Voice must find some way to come to terms with. Their Legacy is an intensely social one and to use it they must interact with Sleepers, often with large groups of Sleepers. However, Whisperers are also keenly aware they are manipulating the people they talk to, and some Whisperers regularly manipulate their fellow mages. While many Whisperers genuinely like people and simply have no problem lying to individuals they like, most are highly social misanthropes who do not particularly care for or about others.</div><div>While some Legacies are declining in favor as the 21st century marches on, the Whisperers are growing more popular \u2014 the growing prevalence of advertising, political spin, online con games and the increasing number of mages who realize the power of the ability to manipulate communication and belief all combine to cause mages to flock to their ranks.</div>",alternateNickname:"Whisperers",orders:"Although this is by no means always true, the stereotypical Whisperer is blandly attractive.

Since there is also power in status and conformity, the business suit is the unofficial uniform of the Whisperers.

Similarly, students who need another participant can either call upon their tutors and give them a substantial cut of any profits for their trouble, or seek out another of the loose association of Whisperers. In contrast, Whisperers who also belong to the Guardians of the Veil are part of a tightly knit organization. These Whisperers are typically deeply enmeshed in the intricacies of the Labyrinth and are often important members of one or more of the central groups. Few Whisperers are willing to take sufficient time away from their magical studies to actually run any of the many groups involved in the Labyrinth. However, a surprising number of the important guest speakers and other major peripheral figures involved in everything from UFO cults to organizations of professional skeptics are skilled Whisperers.

If he is controlling the hand directly, the mage must take an instant action for the hand to perform a task. In addition, the mage can use his Cog in the Machine Attainment to temporarily add additional functions to the hand, either while attached or while it\u2019s separated.</div><div><i>Variation:</i> Independent Eye. Instead of his hand, the mage replaces his eye. The mage\u2019s eye and optic nerve can detach from his skull, and extend small legs allowing it to scuttle about (with the same traits as the hand, above). The mage can see whatever the eye sees. If the mage possesses Space 2, he can reflexively direct the eye\u2019s movements regardless of distance; otherwise, if the eye leaves sensory range, he must concentrate to maintain contact with the eye (and he can\u2019t regain contact if his concentration is ever broken). In addition, the mage can use his Cog in the Machine Attainment to temporarily add additional functions to the eye, either while attached or while it\u2019s separated.</div><div><b>Prehensile Eyes</b></div><div><b>Effect:</b> The mage\u2019s eyes can extend from their sockets on articulated stalks up to four feet long.

Examples include a blade or spike inside the arm, razor-like teeth that retract into the jaws or a strangling wire inside the wrist. The weapon can be accessed or hidden at will as an instant action and remains attached to the mage when in use. Once per scene, the mage can bestow the armor-piercing quality upon the weapon. Per the Matter 3 spell of that name, for each dot of Matter the mage possesses, the next and subsequent dice rolls made using the object are granted armor-piercing status.</div><div><b>Circulation Upgrade</b></div><div><b>Effect:</b> The mage\u2019s circulatory system has been altered, so that when this enhancement is activated, her blood is infused with a sticky, viscous oil. This fluid causes any tears in the mage\u2019s skin to seal themselves, stopping blood loss. For each point of Mana the mage expends, she may heal one lethal wound or two bashing wounds. Note that this doesn\u2019t repair damage to the Austere\u2019s mechanical body parts.</div><div><b>Secondary Body</b></div><div><b>Effect:</b> The mage creates a tiny automaton that is stored in his chest cavity. Once released, the device unfolds itself into a human-like form that stands one-fifth the size of the mage. While the mage enters a trance state and concentrates, he can project his awareness into the puppet, operating it and perceiving through it as if it were his own body. The device has the same Physical and Mental Attributes as the mage, including Health and Defense (except that the device\u2019s Size is 1), and uses the mage\u2019s Mental Attributes when active. The mage cannot cast spells while he is operating the small body, but any spell that he casts upon himself before activating the device will affect the automaton as well. As the device has no mind of its own, it can only operate under the mage\u2019s direction. If the automaton moves out of sensory range, the mage must concentrate to maintain contact with it unless he has Space 2 or greater (in which case maintaining control is a reflexive action).

Many Free Councilors are dedicated to revolutionary ideals, but few as much as the Blank Badges, who craft their very souls toward the overthrow of the Lie and all who support it, who give up their own identities in a quest for a greater identity, and a greater destiny, for all.</div><div>This Legacy is descended from one of the first cabals of the Free Council, formed during the Nameless War. These outcast mages took their Nameless status as a badge of honor, wearing white or blank badges as a sign of their allegiances, or some other white token, from a flower to a handkerchief. They said the white was for purity, but it also represented limitless potential, a clearing away of all the detritus of centuries of mystical tradition that bound the so-called Atlantean orders in chains of expectations and limitations. To be a mage, according to the Blank Badges, was to cast off such things and to embrace limitless potential and possibilities.</div><div>The cabal survived the Nameless War and the formation and recognition of the Free Council, eventually becoming a true Legacy that forged and reshaped the souls of young mystics initiated into its ways. Not all survived, because the Blank Badges explored the edges of mystical knowledge, fighting to push back the boundaries, while at the same time defying the power of the Seers of the Throne and their Exarch masters. Better to burn out than the fade away was their motto long before it came into vogue amongst the Sleepers.</div><div>For decades, the Badges have been on the forefront of the war against the agents of the Lie, but theirs is a secret war, much as the Nameless War between the Atlantean orders that created their Legacy.

The fifth point of the so-called Pentacle has gone from hot and fluid as an eruption to cooling and hardening into unyielding stone. As so many revolutionaries before them, Free Councilors are becoming the New Order, and the Blank Badges don\u2019t like the sound of that at all. Therefore, the Legacy has gone from the core of the movement to the periphery of it, pushed out by their own nature, where they continue to follow the Legacy of their souls: revolution, evolution and defiance of expectations.</div><div>Their revolutionary nature keeps the Blank Badges on the forefront of the struggle against the Exarchs and their servants, the Seers of the Throne. While the Seers have largely lumped the Free Council in with the Atlantean orders since the Nameless refused to ally with the Seers more than a century ago, they remain keenly aware of the Invisible Company due to their penchant for provoking Paradox and stirring up trouble, to say nothing of their habit of killing Seers when they have the opportunity.</div><div>Some Pentacle mages try to keep the Blanks from drawing too much attention to the mystical community, because it only leads to Seer offensives and crackdowns, but others see the activities of the Legacy as a useful smokescreen.

The Blanks, of course, see order mages who try to stay their hand as Exarch apologists and collaborators, traitors to the cause.</div><div>The Blanks therefore exist on the outer edges of Awakened society, acknowledged as members of the Free Council and afforded the protection of Awakened tradition and protocol, even if they don\u2019t respect it themselves.

So say the Cryptologos, the Legacy of the \u201cHidden Word.\u201d Words, language, are the first true magic, the power of the Awakened or conscious mind. Language allowed humanity to express and share thoughts, to communicate effectively, to survive and to build a civilization. Without it, humans are no better than cunning animals; with it, their potential is limitless.</div><div>While there have always been mystics interested in the intricacies of language, and the Cryptologos draw upon their traditions, the Legacy itself is fairly recent in origin. The Legacy\u2019s roots are dug into the science of language, the modern development of linguistics and, later, concepts such as ur-languages, root language and neuro-linguistic programming (NLP). Mages, just as mundane scientists, asked the questions: Where did language come from? How did it develop? How do we turn abstract and arbitrary sounds into meaning? Of course, the willworkers had something of an advantage in that they could study High Speech, what they believed was the true root of all human language.</div><div>Of course, the Cryptics were not so sanguine about the myths of Atlantis and the Fall of the Celestial Ladder. They believed High Speech was a kind of ur-language but not necessarily that it was proof of an ancient island nation of mage-kings who challenged the gods. Instead, most of the younger mystics who became the founders of the Legacy saw the Atlantis myth as just that, a metaphor, an interpretation of a time when language first developed and wielded power over not just our perception and definition of reality, but reality itself.</div><div>The \u201cfall\u201d for the Cryptologos is not a failed rebellion against Celestial forces, but a splintering of the true root language, High Speech, into diverse dialects and tongues, none with the true power of the First Language to encompass and define reality. High Speech became polluted and drifted, and so humanity fell asleep, because they could not longer truly communicate with the world around them or each other.</div><div>The rejection of the history and orthodoxy of the Atlantean traditions ensured the scholars of the Hidden Word were outcasts, called radicals or heretics. They continue to research and expand their theories on their own, and find like-minded willworkers as allies in the struggle against the ignorance and dogma of the Atlantean orders. The Hidden Word\u2019s discoveries lent weight to their theories as the first Wordsmiths began shaping their souls to match their knowledge of High Speech and their voices were truly heard for the first time. Even masters of the old orders were impressed (and concerned) at the words of power rolling off the tongues of these rebellious new mages.</div><div>Although the Cryptologos learned that the Hidden Word was a source of power and influence, their true goal was always knowledge and understanding. They rejected the ways of the Diamond only because of their close-mindedness. So when the Nameless War came to an end and the Seers of the Throne offered an alliance, eager for the secrets the Cryptics and others had discovered and forged in the fires of conflict, most of the members of the Legacy refused. They would not turn their wisdom to domination and control. Some lore of the Hidden Word found its way into the Seers\u2019 hands, and it is something the mages of the Legacy don\u2019t like to discuss to the present day.</div><div>In the Free Council, the Cryptologos found allies and supporters for their theories and an environment where they could pursue their studies, seeking to reconstruct the First Language and, in the decades since, they have continued: seeking out ancient ruins, looking for tablets, carvings, crumbling scrolls and ancient, preserved texts. They collect songs, poems and lore, sifting through them for hints about words in High Speech, and they design elaborate programs intended to compare root-words from hundreds of languages in hopes of rediscovering lost elements of the First Speech.</div><div>Although the Hidden Words rejected Atlantean orthodoxy at their founding, they have taken on a strongly mystical bent of their own, their quest for the truth of High Speech consuming them. Many Cryptics believe that reassembling the scattered True Language is the key to bridging the Abyss and healing the rift between the Supernal and Fallen Worlds. Indeed, the Cryptics see that rift as a gulf of ignorance, a manifestation of the sundering of language that occurred in the Fall of the Celestial Ladder. While many Cryptologos maintain a fairly detached and scientific view of their research, others are fanatical devotes of the Hidden Word, believing that the final keystone in their search is the True Name of Creation, which will bring about a new age when it is known and spoken once more.</div>",alternateNickname:"Cryptics, Hidden Words, Wordsmiths",orders:"",appearance:"Avid readers and scholars, Cryptics tend to look the part.

Of course, they also have large vocabularies, and many are overly fond of showing them off (while the rest know better and match their speech to the occasion).</div>",background:"The Hidden Words most often come from academic or literary backgrounds, people most concerned with language and words.

Some pursued tantalizing hints of the First Language, discovering greater truths than they could have imagined, and all of the Hidden Words stress the moment when they wrote their names within the Watchtowers, usually their first true use of High Speech.<div>Most of the current generation of Cryptologos found mentors in the Legacy before or not long after Awakening, so they were taught the Legacy from the beginning. Others found their way to the Hidden Words from the ranks of the Free Council, with a small handful of mages drawn to the Legacy from the other Atlantean orders by the power of the Word. Similar to other Free Councilors, Cryptics tend toward a modern and what they consider \u201crealistic\u201d attitude about magic, the Awakened world, and mystic history.

The first was the explosion of the Cosmic All, the fiat lux that brought Creation into being and made the Supernal and Fallen Worlds, back before the Abyss separated them and they were all a part of one Creation, one true world. But that explosion only made space and time, matter and energy. The second explosion came from the human mind, and it created everything else: language, tools, mathematics, art, dance, cities, laws, literature, science, technology, religion, poetry, war, history. It created magic. Everything in the world made by human hands, and human ideas came out of the human mind and soul, the human imagination.</div><div>After all, what is magic except the ability to imagine something that doesn\u2019t yet exist and make it real?

Still, the mages of this Legacy believe in using what you are given to its fullest extent, and in the magic of creation and imagination.</div><div>Although there have always been crafters with a touch of the arcane to them, the Imagineers trace their origins to the development of the science of psychology and the study of the mind. In particular, they owe many of their ideas to theories about dreaming, imagination and the universal unconscious. Young willworkers in the 19th century studied these ideas, and placed the mind at the summit of the mystic hierarchy. The Temenos, they claimed, was the source of all things that could be imagined, thus the entire contents of the mind was born there, and all creations of the mind had their roots deep in that realm.</div><div>If all things of the mind ultimately came from the Temenos, they reasoned, then that realm was a treasure trove of all that could ever possibly be imagined. It was simply a matter of exploring deeply enough to find what the dream consciousness of Creation had to offer, and to bring those nuggets of inspiration back and manifest them in the Fallen World, like divers plumbing the ocean depths for pearls and sunken treasure. The Imagineers swore not only to explore hitherto unknown realms of thought, but to bring them to the people.</div><div>While they earned praise for their bold willingness to explore the astral planes, the proto-Imagineers bought the scorn of the Atlantean orders with the coin of skepticism. For all the Imagineers\u2019 love of imagination and its wonders, they were materialists and dualists, dividing all Creation into things of the First Creation (that of the formation of the Tapestry) and things of the Second Creation (the fruits of the imagination). More importantly, they placed most, if not all, occult and spiritual lore in the second category. Gods, spirits, eidolons, eikones, powers and principalities were all the offspring of human genius, the Imagineers said. Real and independent entities they might be (with an emphasis on might), but they originated in the womb of dreams, born out of human consciousness.</div><div>Such attitudes earned the Imagineers no friends within the Atlantean orders (the gods, for their part, largely remained silent on the matter). This suited the Dreamsmiths well enough, as they were more interested in exploring the potential of Creation, not cataloging and endlessly re-reading its past like the hidebound Atlantean orders. They joined the ranks of the new generation of willworkers in repudiating the orders, leading to the Nameless War. For their part, the Imagineers had little to do with the war, apart from providing aid and comfort to their allies.</div><div>Once the conflict ended, however, the Idealists were quick to surface from their explorations of the Astral depths to put forth some of the many ideas they discovered. They called for the new order to be founded upon reason tempered with imagination and a sense of wonder, and for the wealth of ideas to be shared amongst all. They were strong proponents for the Lorehouse system adopted by the Free Council, and gave freely of their stores of knowledge and inspiration (even if some of those ideas were a bit crackpot, even by Free Council standards).</div><div>Modern Imagineers often cite the Nameless War and the formation of the Free Council as a turning point in history, and point to the explosion of progress since.

However, the vast majority believe that theory cannot be separated from practice in any useful fashion and spend much of their time examining and experimenting with various unusual types of magic\u2019s and various unusual phenomena. Most members of this Legacy are tireless in their pursuit of new styles of magic. They regularly seek out the oldest or most obscure rotes they can find in the hope that some features in these magical formulas will reveal some deeper truth about magic. These mages tirelessly study newly discovered rotes and any notes about magical theory written by those who created these rotes. However, these same Seekers also actively experiment with any new rotes they find, seeking unusual quirks or advantages in their use.</div><div>In their efforts to further understand the nature of magic, many Seekers also attempt to learn as much as they can about the various other unusual phenomena found in the World of Darkness. Some study the limited mortal phenomena of thaumaturgy or psychic powers (see Second Sight for further information on both phenomena); others become fascinated with the Abyss and the various intruders into reality (see Intruders: Encounters with the Abyss for further information). Some Seekers attempt to learn all they can about the various other supernatural beings who also inhabit the World of Darkness, and many seek to learn all they can about Twilight, the Shadow Realm and the spirits that inhabit it. Because of these studies, many Seekers amass large collections of esoteric books and occult relics, ranging from decades-old books on psychic powers, vials of vampire blood and strange relics physically retrieved from the Shadow Realm or the Underworld.

After an individual died, women of his family, village, clan or tribe would gather together and enter into a formalized mourning for the departed. Unlike modern funerary rituals that are often somber and near-silent affairs, keeners wept and wailed, bemoaning the loss of the departed soul while extolling his virtues at great length and volume. They shared stories and songs of his wisdom, strength and generosity, accompanied by swaying, chanting or rhythmic clapping in ritualized mourning ceremonies that carried on for days. The more formal aspects of the keening were frequently interspersed with bouts of distraught moaning and tears as the keeners showed their despondency at the loss of such a great person. </div><div>The more powerful, well-known or loved an individual was, the louder and longer his mourners would keen his loss, leading to long and often outlandish spectacles after the death of particularly popular people. Such bits of drama also provided something of an \u201cemotional screen\u201d \u2014 in the presence of such a spectacle, those who might not normally allow themselves to grieve could do so without shame. </div><div>The more important the mourners at the funeral, the greater honor was accorded to the deceased. Thus, while a veritable army of mourners might attend a funeral, should noblewomen or other ladies of importance appear and mourn openly, they lent some of their prestige to the deceased. Some families even claimed that their families were so integral to the soul of Ireland that the fairy women came to mourn the passing of their scions. Some even claimed that the fairy women mourned them before their deaths \u2014 such families have their own bean s\xeddhe, or banshee, who presage their deaths. </div><div>Even among the Singers in Silence themselves, the origins of the Legacy are uncertain. Oral tradition has almost certainly enhanced and manipulated the facts of the Banshee creation tale, although, as with many of the spoken Mysteries, the Truth of the story remains. What is known is that a woman of early Ireland, Brea, who led her tribe in their struggles against the Fomorii, is accorded the honor of being first of the Singers in Silence. </div><div>The Banshee are oftentimes misunderstood by those outside of the Legacy, and more than once in their history, they have been in danger of being labeled as Left-Handed. In truth, however, while some Singers have certainly been driven mad by their Attainments and nudged well into the dark ways, the Legacy is no more Left-Handed than fate \u2014 or death \u2014 itself. </div><div>Favor (and fear) of the Bean S\xeddhe have waxed and waned during the history of the Pentacle. During some time periods, the Singers were actively hunted. During the Great Depression, a male Singer was alleged to have \u201caided\u201d in the suicides of more than a thousand Sleepers when financial disaster struck, leaving them and their families with few options for survival. Arguing that his victims \u201cwanted it, begged for it,\u201d the Banshee was brought up on trial by his local Consilium, and the proceedings erupted into violence and fervor that eventually led to his destruction after he publicly threatened to use his Attainments on not only the members of the jury council but also on their Sleeper families as well.</div><div>However, in other times, the Banshee have gained a reputation as useful and dedicated counselors: the life of a mage is rarely a peaceful one, and the costs of standing against the Lie are often high. When grief strikes deep within the heart of an Awakened, threatening to send him mad with rage or depression,  a Singer is sometimes able to reach within and aid the mage in purging herself of the pain. Such interventions, however, are rarely called upon in anything but the most dire of circumstances; even in the best of times, few who have heard the legends of the Banshee are willing to risk asking for their aid.</div><div>Mystagogues from outside of the Legacy sometimes attempt to use the Banshee\u2019s inherent relationship with departed souls to glean information that is otherwise difficult to obtain or confirm.

Their features become sunken, their body bony and, by the later Attainments, their skin pales to an ashen gray, regardless of their racial heritage.<div>While Sleeper legends attribute only feminine traits to the Banshee, not all Singers in Silence are female. Historically speaking, however, a disproportionately large number have been, and many traditional Bean S\xeddhe will not consider taking a male student in the Legacy. The reasons for this vary. Some, especially those who are most devoted to rediscovering and preserving the ancient mysteries of the British Isles, believe that to introduce men to the Legacy is an affront to the memory of Brea and her cabal sisters.</div>",background:"Banshee come from no single background. While most experience a great tragedy immediately before entering the Legacy, for some this was a single traumatic event in an otherwise happy existence, while for others it was merely the culmination of years of misery and pain.<div>Despite the name, not all Singers were musically inclined before entering the Legacy, either. Their keening song is as often a product solely of their Attainment as it is a predisposition toward musical expression. Some, although certainly not all, had an interest in the Celtic culture or history before being approached by the mentor who would eventually induct them into the Legacy. A good number of these were involved, as mystagogues, in researching and preserving the oral traditions of early civilizations, but just as many were Curators or Censors, rather than directly being involved in the acquisition of lost knowledge.</div><div>Most of the Singers are female as well.

Those who have first entered the Legacy tend to cling tightly to their teachers for a time; after all, few but other Singers can truly understand the burden their Attainments bestow upon them. Banshee mentors not only tutor their students in the Legacy itself, but also often act as grief counselors, aiding them in transitioning through the cataclysmic event that leads most Banshee to this path.<div>However, no matter how vital the Legacy was to their recovery from whatever tragedy goaded them into entering it, in time most Banshee come to resent their teachers with an unyielding vigor. The burdens Banshee receive as a part of their first Attainment are weighty, and eventually most students come to blame their teachers for having ever offered the Legacy to them. This reaction, and the resultant separation between student and mentor, is so common among the Banshee that the phenomenon has its own name. Students leaving are said to be \u201cin waning,\u201d a separation that may only last days or weeks, but in some cases can go on for years. Almost inevitably, however, a waning Singer finds that her burden is, if anything, greater when borne alone, and will return to her mentor for additional training after a period of separation. This cycle often repeats itself after each Attainment.</div><div>Occasionally, a Banshee mentor will spend years or decades gathering a group of students around her to aid with resolution of a major or ongoing tragedy. These groups, called Choirs, sometimes stay together for lengthy periods, but most often go their own separate ways once the immediate issue at hand is resolved. This is in part because in proximity to each other the Banshee all suffer the effects of each one\u2019s personal torment: a malicious or mischievous ghost who plagues one of the Singer plagues them all, and when this is increased five-or six-fold the situation can quickly become unbearable. As well, a larger group of Singers is more likely to draw the attention of others (Sleeper and Awakened alike), who misunderstand the nature of Singers\u2019 Attainments. The likelihood of repercussions from those who do not understand or agree with Banshee duties is far greater when gathered as a group, while a solitary Banshee\u2019s impact on an area is more easily hidden.</div>",suggestedOblations:"Singing, creating laments (songs, poems or stories), attending a funeral, playing a harp or hand-drum, preparing a body for burial, ritualistic prayers for the departed, performing euthanasia.",concepts:"Matriarch who has outlived her family, hospice worker, emergency room nurse, anthropologist, funeral director, nursing home attendant, vigilante, nihilist.",historySocietyCulture:"",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"The mystic gifts of the Singers in Silence drive an ever-widening wedge between members of the Legacy and the rest of the human world, Awakened as well as Sleeping.

Only then does the dream of the Unforgotten find them.</div><div>Rising from the murky depths of the Dreamtime to touch a mage\u2019s subconscious during sleep or deep meditation, the Unforgotten manifests as a vast, undefined shape moving beneath a cold, black sea or glimpsed in silhouette behind thick ice. Cloaked in such perceptual metaphors, the Unforgotten murmurs in the polyphonic cacophony of every genius whose works have perished. In this borrowed chorus, the Unforgotten communicates its respect for the mage\u2019s greatness and echoes his outrage that such greatness should ever fade from the world. The entity never bothers to surface unless a mage is already susceptible to such advances, but if rebuffed, it silently descends back into the Dreamtime until the clarion of desperation summons it again. Unless rejected, however, the presence remains, pressing gently at the back of the mage\u2019s mind with the intimacy of a lover\u2019s caress. Just as a perfect imaginary friend, the entity discusses its latest companion\u2019s interests, patiently waiting when the mage must attend to conscious matters.</div><div>As the dialogue progresses, the Unforgotten begins offering useful advice.

Over time, these mages grow increasingly erratic and frustrated that those around them do not share their fervor, or worse, try to block their creative efforts. Such frustration usually gives way to paranoia and social isolation. In the absence of external companionship, Dreamers place increasing trust in the Unforgotten as the only being in the world that really understands and appreciates them. Its counsel becomes a constant companion, mixing practical advice with Socratic questions and the occasional enigmatic clue, encouraging scions to think for themselves and refine their own ideas.</div><div>Whatever the Dreamers\u2019 interests and fields of study, the Unforgotten Scions are universally devoted to the genesis and propagation of their ideas. Any moral qualms that might limit such actions soon fall by the wayside as the madness of the desperate creator consumes them like divine fire. The Legacy\u2019s Attainments only accelerate this decay, providing tools whereby others can be set ablaze with similar madness.

The order\u2019s dedication to knowledge for the sake of knowledge opens the door for members to take that precept too far, losing their Wisdom to the incarnate hubris of the Unforgotten. Thankfully, long centuries of rooting out infections of the Legacy have given the Mysterium the practice and tools needed to do so. Mages who are too vocal in the promotion of their works past the point of reason can expect to be watched closely for the telltale Attainments and summarily dealt with if such evidence appears. While not as commonly afflicted, the Guardians of the Veil also lose their share of members to this Left-Handed Legacy when they allow the Mysteries they defend to become more important than the defenders themselves. Paradoxically, other orders suffer more when rare Unforgotten Scions emerge from their ranks, as the orders seldom have any idea what to look for and don\u2019t know how to deal with the problem until it is too late. Opposition to the Legacy is further complicated by the fact that knowledge of the Unforgotten increases the likelihood of contact, so the orders prudently restrict and censor such research.

While this arrangement means that Dreamers effectively have a \u201cteacher on tap\u201d and needn\u2019t worry about finding or maintaining contact with another member of their Legacy, the downside is that the link between \u201cteacher\u201d and student cannot be severed (voluntarily or otherwise) and does not break when a mage learns the third Attainment.

The Unforgotten does nothing to stop such conflicts, as it cares only for its personal relationships with each Scion and is entirely indifferent to how they interact amongst themselves. The strangest of the Dreamers are those who embrace the Unforgotten in support of a collective idea, with each member accepting that the work of the group is more important than themselves.

For every wizard who marvels at the technological triumphs of the 21 century, there are those who lament such ubiquitous power, bitterly wondering what value their hard-earned rotes hold when anyone might fly or speak to another across the expanse of continents or lay waste to nations with forces wrested from radiant ores. What was once wondrous has become commonplace, no longer a reward of singular genius and invincible will. Worst of all, these advances threaten magic itself by offering mages quick-and-dirty alternatives to their Arcana.</div><div>While such pessimistic elitism is not uncommon among mages, most eventually reconcile themselves with some facet of modernity, or else ennui consumes them utterly.

As much antiques as antiquarians, history as historians, the Wraiths of Epochs have never found broad acceptance as a Legacy, though they are older than most traditions they preserve. From the Fall of Atlantis, they lingered among its ruins as living ghosts, anchoring themselves to the ideals of reminisced greatness. As history unfolded, they watched and remembered while the Abyss gnawed at the threads of human accomplishment and potential.

They do not accept that all good things pass, despite the grim preponderance of evidence to the contrary.</div><div>Despite their reputation, the Wraiths of Epochs do not reject technology out of ignorance or geriatric rigidity, and they aren\u2019t inherently antagonistic to every invention on principle. Rather, their philosophy lays blame at the convenience of technology to distract mages from exploring their own power, thereby atrophying what magic remains in the world. Raised in an age of cell phones and rockets, most Wraiths fully comprehend the seductive lure of the modern. The Legacy draws new members from those willing to surrender conveniences for deeper truths. In the eyes of Wraith luminaries, mages unable or unwilling to make such ascetic sacrifices lack the devotion to advance in the Legacy\u2019s mysteries.</div><div>Because of their myopic focus, the Wraiths of Epochs find few recruits. It is not enough that a potential Wraith be enamored of history, as so many mages are. A disciple must also reject the modern world so fiercely that he is willing to cut himself off from its advances. Such rejection can stem from disgust or horror or even an irresistible longing for a better and purer time. Whatever the motivation, candidates must endure extensive trials to test their commitment before a Wraith will help them craft their souls.</div><div>These tests begin simply enough, initially intended to inconvenience and annoy. If the candidate persists, successive trials gradually sever him from the aspects of modernity he most values. Only when a mage fully divests himself of distractions and embraces a lifestyle of contemplative isolation can he make the final sacrifice, forsaking future for past as he gives up happiness, prosperity and the comforting illusion that he matters in the grand design of the universe.</div><div>Within the mage community, Wraiths of Epochs generally go unnoticed unless someone wants to consult them on some aspect of the past or lure them out of passive research with the promise of new archeological finds. Although Wraiths seldom eschew politics entirely, having immersed themselves in enough cycles of civilization to recognize the dangers of total isolation, most find such endeavors distasteful as a matter of principle and prefer to hide behind heavy occultation and a reputation of disinterested neutrality whenever possible. The most politically active Wraiths work within the Mysterium to guide the order\u2019s research toward the secrets of the past rather than contemporary lore. From an adversarial standpoint, Wraiths violently oppose the Cult of the Doomsday Clock (see Legacies: The Sublime, p. 128), whose calculated disruptions threaten the past as much as the future. The Ticktock men reciprocate this enmity, as Wraith Attainments can pierce the truth of destroyed time in ways most magic cannot.</div><div>Among Sleepers, Wraiths of Echoes who maintain visible mortal lives typically find work as teachers, librarians, museum curators and other specialized jobs at the fringes of academia, allowing Wraiths to disguise their anachronisms as perfectly \u201cnormal\u201d behavior for their profession.

At the most basic level, Atlantean events cannot be dated in relation to the present, but the problem is more complicated than that. Atlantis is as much allegory as fact, based on intertwined cosmological precepts that defy logical analysis and creative interpretation. Those mages who have managed to obtain sufficient temporal sympathy from scavenged relics to glimpse anything of Atlantis have offered contradictory accounts as rich in obscure symbolism as most tangled enigmas of Temenos, filtered as they are through the cracked lens of imperfect Gnosis and Wisdom. While such extraordinary visions can offer valuable insights, they are ultimately shadows of a more perfect truth that no mage alive can or perhaps even should understand.

Thus, they know that mages are in a treacherous position by dint of their numbers. The Awakened are rare, and it\u2019s only because of their penchant for remaining hidden (and their power, obviously) that they survive. But what happens when the Seers of the Throne or Banishers, or some more esoteric enemy, attack and kill the Wise of a given area? The survivors have no way to shore up their numbers. They can\u2019t make more mages.</div><div>The mages of the Awakening Gambit beg to differ. By analysis and careful manipulation, they say, it is possible to arrange a scenario in which a person must either Awaken or perish. These \u201cKingmakers\u201d step in only if the target seems to be leaning more toward the \u201cperish\u201d option, but otherwise they welcome a new mage, a mage who is already suited by the circumstances of his Awakening to join the Arrow.</div><div>Obviously, this position is controversial. Manipulating a mortal\u2019s fate this way can legitimately be viewed as a violation of the Lex Magica, and certainly as an act of hubris. Also, some mages see the Gambit\u2019s strategy as trying to \u201ccheat the system,\u201d arranging false crises so that a mage\u2019s soul is tricked into waking up. What kinds of mages are created from such situations, they wonder? Are these mages dishonest, perhaps with a penchant for underhanded manipulation themselves? Are the Kingmakers, in fact, making more mages like them?</div><div>Other mages, though, see the Kingmakers\u2019 actions as perfectly viable. The Fallen World isn\u2019t a product of magic, after all; it\u2019s a product of the war between the Exarchs and the Oracles. Clearly, laws for Awakening exist, so why not exploit them? The concern isn\u2019t one of ethics, but of efficacy \u2014 do the Gambit\u2019s tactics work?</div><div>Whether or not they do (see the sidebar), the Awakening Gambit Legacy is tolerated and not viewed as left-handed for two reasons. First, the Kingmakers are planners and logicians without peer \u2014 they have to be, to do what they do \u2014 and that\u2019s good for the order. Second, the Kingmakers have a reputation within the order as being good judges of character and highly moral in their own right (with respect to matters other than arranging people\u2019s fates like pawns on a chessboard, that is). If the Gambit has an agenda beyond their stated one, they hide it extremely well.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>So, Does It Work?</h3><div>The data are inconclusive. It might work. Mages do seem to arise from the situations that the Gambit creates. But even then, are the Kingmakers putting people in situations in which they Awaken, or just choosing people who would have Awakened anyway and acting as the catalyst? Since conclusive data on the number of people who Awaken and under what circumstances aren\u2019t really available, it\u2019s hard to say if the Kingmakers\u2019 actions really have the effect they want.</div><div>For purposes of your chronicle, the Storyteller doesn\u2019t necessarily need to decide whether the Kingmakers\u2019 methods work consistently. All she needs to decide is whether they work in any particular instance. The players \u2014 and their characters \u2014 can draw their own conclusions from there.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The World as a Chessboard</h3><div>The Awakening Gambit takes much of its inspiration, even its name, from the game of chess. Almost all members of the Legacy are avid players (and many also partake of other strategy games, such as Go and mah jong). In chess, the \u201cgambit\u201d is an opening strategy, one that usually involves a sacrifice for better position. The Kingmakers see what they do as a sacrifice \u2014 they are giving up their own time, their resources and, in some cases, their Wisdom (depending on their methods) for the chance to bring new mages into the fold.</div><div>Chess terminology permeates the Legacy, and the extended metaphor serves as the method for teaching new members. To the Gambit, the ability to keep a given strategy in mind while also looking after a score of pieces is paramount, because it is with just such complicated stratagems that they seek to Awaken new mages.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Making of Kings</h3><div>How do the Kingmakers go about arranging Awakenings? The process is a difficult one, and it\u2019s by no means something the Kingmakers do constantly. They recognize that manipulating Destiny this way is dangerous, and so it\u2019s usually only something they attempt when the numbers of mages in the area have fallen for some reason, or when the Arrow is expecting trouble in the near future. But the Gambit mages (sometimes in conjunction with Mysterium or Guardian cabals) keep tabs on Sleepers who would make good mages, and create several scenarios in which the Kingmakers could arrange an Middlegame (see below) should it become necessary.</div><div>The Kingmakers structure their scenarios on the game of chess. In the Opening, the Kingmakers choose their target and learn everything they can about her. Each Kingmaker has his own criteria for choosing, rejecting or accepting a potential mage. Some Kingmakers assume that people with families make the best mages, while other Kingmakers won\u2019t even consider Sleepers with such firmly established ties to the mundane world. A Gambit mage might delve into a Sleeper\u2019s family tree, looking for mages, while another looks only at her immediate circle of family and friends, searching for hints of the supernatural.</div><div>A crucial part of the Opening is exposure to magic. It\u2019s a violation of the Lex Magica, yes, but the Gambit considers it paramount to test the target\u2019s reaction to vulgar magic. The Kingmaker usually brings another member of the Legacy (or his cabal, if the members are sympathetic) to keep things from getting out of control, and chooses a vulgar spell that\u2019s obviously magical but that isn\u2019t going to kill anyone if it misfires (unless the Kingmaker is cocksure, which happens). The usual response is Disbelief, and the Gambit doesn\u2019t consider anything wrong with that. Sometimes, though, a target meets vulgar magic with a different reaction \u2014 anger, curiosity, fear \u2014 and holds on to that feeling even after the memory has faded. Occasionally, the target seems to \u201cfeel\u201d the magic coming before the spell goes off (in game terms, the mortal has the Unseen Sense Merit). Any abnormality is note and interpreted, but whether it cements the decision to continue the Gambit or is viewed as a \u201cdeal-breaker\u201d depends on the mage in question.</div><div>Once the mage feels that he has enough information on the target (which can take months or more), he makes a decision: to press on with the Gambit, to reject the Sleeper outright or to \u201cshelve\u201d the Sleeper against a time when she might be more suitable to the Gambit (or the Gambit has need of her).</div><div>If the mage decides to press on, the Gambit enters the Middlegame. In this stage, the Kingmaker crafts a scenario precisely designed to play to the person\u2019s strengths and weaknesses in an attempt to back the target into a corner. The target, ideally, has only two choices: Awaken or die.</div><div>The Middlegame always involves some crisis, but the varieties are limitless. Some Kingmakers prefer to isolate their targets, because it\u2019s easier to arrange things without too many other conflicting factors. Others feel that having large numbers of Sleepers around makes for more powerful and capable mages should the Awakening \u201ctake.\u201d The Awakening Gambit views Sleepers involved in a target\u2019s Middlegame as \u201cpawns.\u201d Sleepwalkers are called \u201cbishops\u201d or \u201crooks\u201d depending on what role they are to play, while mages (or other supernatural beings) who are unaware of what\u2019s going on are called \u201cknights.\u201d A mage (or, potentially, another supernatural being) who is aware of the Kingmaker\u2019s plan and is willingly helping is a \u201cqueen.\u201d The \u201cking,\u201d of course, is the target herself. These terms are just shorthand that the Kingmakers use when setting up the scenario. Once the mage figures out exactly what role a given \u201cpiece\u201d needs to play, he refers to her by a name rather than the title.</div><div>The Middlegame is planned as meticulously as possible, leaving as little to chance as the Kingmaker can manage. Mages with proficiency in Mind as well as Fate often do a \u201cdry run\u201d in their own dreams, trying to account for the variables of the situation and identify any variables that they are missing. In the end, though, it\u2019s impossible to take everything into account, and so expecting the unexpected is crucial to the Kingmakers\u2019 work.</div><div>One facet of the Gambit that the mage always spends time on is the Failsafe. The Failsafe is the mage\u2019s strategy for extraction \u2014 saving the Sleeper\u2019s life should she fail to Awaken or otherwise save herself. This might involve setting up a portal with the Space Arcanum or preparing a powerful healing spell (or both), depending on the capabilities of the mage and what he expects to happen.</div><div>Before putting the Middlegame into effect, the Kingmaker and any knowing allies he enlists spend time in meditation before beginning. This meditation is meant to put the Kingmaker\u2019s intentions in the right place, and hopefully ensure that they will have the purity of heart to see it through (see p. 51 of the World of Darkness Rulebook for more on meditation and its game effects). When the Middlegame begins, the rest is in the target\u2019s hands. The resolution \u2014 the Endgame \u2014 is one of three possibilities.The simplest is that something goes wrong, some unforeseen occurrence that the mage cannot control or mitigate. The mage aborts and takes the Middlegame back to the drawing board (and always spends time in deep analysis to make sure that whatever interfered wasn\u2019t the result of someone else, such as the Seers of the Throne, taking a hand).</div><div>The desirable outcome, of course, is for the target to Awaken. In this case, the mage allows the target to handle as much of the crisis as she can, but does step in to prevent death and destruction as necessary. The new mage is then welcomed to the Awakened community, and is expected (though not technically required) to join the Adamantine Arrow.</div><div>Finally, the target might fail to Awaken. The Failsafe is put into effect, and hopefully the Kingmaker saves the Sleeper\u2019s life and the lives of those around her. The target is watched sporadically afterwards, in case she should Awaken later, but for the most part, the experience is chalked up to learning, and the Kingmaker looks for a new potential mage.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Examples</h3><div>A single father of two comes to the attention of a Kingmaker, who feels that despite his heavy responsibilities (or rather, because of them) he would make a good recruit. Since the focus of his life is his children, the Kingmaker decides to use them in the Middlegame. He entices the kids to get on the wrong bus one day on the way home, and watches the man\u2019s panic as he can\u2019t find his children.</div><div>He does the sensible thing \u2014 notify the police \u2014 but that\u2019s not enough for him. He starts an in-depth search of the area where his kids were last seen, talks to people, pays for information from some passersby and works his way closer to his kids. The children, meanwhile, have been shunted from place to place all day courtesy of the Kingmaker\u2019s magic (but kept safe all the while). The Middlegame is a race \u2014 can the man get his kids back before they step off the last bus, miles away from anywhere they recognize? The father finds himself wandering amidst a gleaming set of iron towers, but can see the threads that lead him directly through the maze to what he loves most, his family. He Awakens as a Mastigos, and the Kingmaker is there to welcome the new mage.</div><div>An EMT has been taking note of odd emergencies in the city for some time, but does not realize they are largely the result of extended conflict between warring Awakened factions. The Kingmakers, hurting from a recent assault from the Seers of the Throne, decide to try to Awaken her. Calling upon intelligence about the Seers, the Kingmakers arrange to attack a lone (but powerful) enemy, and influence a Sleeper witness to call for an ambulance. The EMT arrives and witnesses the Kingmaker and the Seer casting spells, but is unable to resist the Disbelief \u2014 instead, she \u201cmerely\u201d does her job, patching up the wounded.</div><div>She demonstrates courage in the face of danger but does not Awaken. The Kingmakers might consider making an ally of her in another capacity, but they write off this Middlegame as a failure. A Sleeper occultist has amassed a collection of magical tomes, and has cross-referenced the information there well enough to see some Supernal correspondences. The Kingmakers figure that it\u2019s only a matter of time until he Awakens anyway, and decide to give him a boost. They arrange for him to be invited to an auction at which several rare books are being sold, one of which is a \u201cplant,\u201d created by an allied cabal and containing dangerous spirit-summoning spells.</div><div>When the auctioneer opens the book, the spirits are released and run amok (but are not powerful enough to do anything but frighten people). The occultist hides under a table, whimpering, and the Kingmakers put the Failsafe into effect \u2014 speaking a trigger phrase, they banish the spirits and wait for Disbelief to kick in. They might later \u201cliberate\u201d a few of the occult books from this man\u2019s collection, since he\u2019s obviously not going to be using them anytime soon.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Gambit and Wisdom</h3><div>The Awakening Gambit does not, in itself, cause degeneration. What a given Kingmaker does during the Gambit, though, very well might. If anyone dies, a degeneration check is required as though the mage had used magic to kill a human being, regardless of how the victim actually died. Mentally coercing pawns and other \u201cpieces\u201d for the Middlegame might cause degeneration, depending on how the mage goes about it.</div>",alternateNickname:"Kingmakers",orders:"The Awakening Gambit is exclusively Adamantine Arrow, but the other orders might become involved with the Gambit occasionally. The Mysterium regards the Gambit as a fascinating experiment, and potentially enlightening about the nature of the Awakening. Therefore, Mysterium mages often wind up as queens or rooks in the Gambit\u2019s endeavors, provided they are allowed the chance to interview any successfully Awakened targets.<div>The Silver Ladder and the Free Council, perhaps surprisingly, have similar reactions to the Gambit. Namely, they either applaud the Legacy\u2019s efforts in trying to codify the Awakening, or they damn the Kingmakers as meddlers and manipulators. Often, whichever attitude one order takes, the other order takes the opposite.</div><div>The Guardians of the Veil, of course, take an extremely dim view of the Awakening Gambit. People Awaken when they are meant to, and forcing the issue doesn\u2019t lead to anything but risk for all involved. It is rumored, though, that the Guardians teach an analogous Legacy to their own Tricksters, and that their gambits are subtle enough to put those of the Arrow to shame. Indeed, Arrows of the Legacy sometimes joke that the whole Awakening Gambit is merely part of a larger Middlegame dreamed up by the Guardians.</div>",appearance:"Kingmakers are meticulous and precise in their plans, and this tends to leak through into their everyday bearing.

The Acanthus who go on to the Gambit tend to worry about the numbers of the Awakened and are frustrated by the inability to decide who becomes a mage. This isn\u2019t necessarily out of egomania; more than one Kingmaker has made a friend of a courageous, honest and forthright Sleeper and wished desperately to be able to bring him into the fold as one of the Wise, for his own benefit and that of the Consilium.<div>Young and inexperienced mages aren\u2019t usually told about the Gambit, and even if they learn about it, they aren\u2019t usually afforded the chance to join. Aside from the fairly stringent magical requirements (see \u201cAttainments\u201d), the kind of work that the Kingmakers do is based on life experience and, more specifically, life experience as a mage. Until an Arrow has a few years with a cabal under her belt, dealing directly with other mages and seeing the kinds of qualities that go into being successful among the Awakened, she probably has no business with the Gambit.</div>",organizzation:"Not every Consilium boasts the presence of the Kingmakers, but those that do tend to have more than one. The Middlegame is much easier to arrange and execute with assistance, and so when a Kingmaker takes a pupil, she usually does so with the assumption that the pupil is going to stay in the area and help her. It\u2019s also not uncommon for Kingmakers to receive requests from nearby cities (and \u201cnearby\u201d is relative) to come and assist with a Gambit, so the Legacy\u2019s members keep informal contact with each other.<div>All Kingmakers are expected to be active members of the Adamantine Arrow. Loners and curmudgeons need not apply \u2014 the Awakening Gambit isn\u2019t necessarily friendly, but it is social. Teachers and pupils often live together during the initial training sessions, and even after the pupil has officially joined the Legacy, his lessons in evaluating Sleepers and constructing the Middlegame continue. The Legacy is therefore a tight-knit fraternity (one of the reasons that it survives despite concerns about its ethics and efficacy).</div>",suggestedOblations:"Meditation, conversation with strangers, volunteering one\u2019s time to a worthy cause, teaching others, organizing a meeting of mages (caucus, forum, tournament), presiding over the Duel Arcane, planning the Middlegame, peoplewatching.",concepts:"Chess coach, computer programmer, social worker, internal affairs detective, military recruiter, head hunter, bartender, cab driver, drug dealer, Consilium Herald, symphony conductor",historySocietyCulture:"",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"The Attainments of the Awakening Gambit are designed to aid in performing the Middlegame.

If the target is a Sleeper and the mage is not attempting to influence behavior directly, no dice roll is required. What effect this has on the target\u2019s behavior is largely a matter for the Storyteller (probably with input from the player), but the Kingmakers usually use this Attainment to clear away uninvolved parties or to nudge pawns in the appropriate directions.

The place lay in ruins, and the first onikaze swordsman made his disciples work to restore it, forbidding them the use of their magics and instead commanding them to work with their own hands and minds, even as he imparted upon them \u2014 some nine students in all \u2014 the secrets of the demon wind. The morning after they had finally completed the years-long work of restoring the temple, Hagetaka\u2019s students awoke to discover their master gone, with kanji inscribed into the cobbles of the courtyard: \u201cThese are merely stones, and the wind ceases its motion for no man. Your hands, your wills, your selves: you need nothing more.\u201d</div><div>To a man, Hagetaka\u2019s students left behind the product of their long labors, going out into the world to put into practice the training that they had been given. Some become great heroes and others, villains, but all took on students of their own, and, in time, the Wave-men as a whole were gradually adopted into the Adamantine Arrow, leaving only a scattered few to carry the philosophy in other directions. Legends tell that the Wave-men periodically gathered at Hagetaka\u2019s temple thereafter, to address matters of great importance to the entire Legacy, but the records of such gatherings are few and considered by most to be largely apocryphal. In modern times, the location of the temple \u2014 if, indeed, it ever truly existed at all \u2014 is lost to the Brotherhood, and most agree that such is for the best. While reverence for the past can be a source of strength and wisdom, it is also attachment, and the way of the Wave-man denies such fetters. As Hagetaka himself said, \u201cThese are merely stones\u2026\u201d</div><div>Spreading across the world at the forefront of the wind from which they take their name, the warriors of the onikaze are wanderers, fighting for the causes that appeal to them or sometimes just those that pay. Some embrace the romance of the samurai and defend the weak and downtrodden, setting their blades against wickedness and tyranny. Others, perhaps more practical, sell their services \u2014 either as swordsmen or as teachers of the martial arts \u2014 to those who can afford them. A rare few even manage to carve out places for themselves and obtain positions of power and respect in established Consilii. Most, however, spend at least some part of their lives as lonely pilgrims, moving from place to place, upon musha shugyo, in an endless pursuit of the perfection of the blade.</div><div>Interestingly, while the Wave-men have always been relatively few, their numbers have survived the trials of time relatively undiminished by various wars and calamities. The very wanderlust that motivates their many quests and keeps them scattered has served to protect them from ordeals that might have grievously wounded or even exterminated a more close-knit Legacy. Thus, while they shall forever remain but few, it is likely that the swordsmen of the onikaze will always be out there, in one way or another.</div>",alternateNickname:"Wave-men",orders:"",appearance:"While the image of the street samurai is a perennial favorite among fans of anime \u2014 in Japan and in the West \u2014 most onikaze swordsmen eschew such trappings, preferring a more practical aesthetic. Since the majority of Wave-men barely manage to get by, their clothing tends to be sturdy and utilitarian; one never knows when a chance to replace a damaged garment will present itself. Denim jeans, heavy boots, leather coats and the like are among the more common wardrobe choices for Brothers of the Demon Wind, as these articles stand up well to a variety of environments and can last for years, if properly cared for. Body decoration, of whatever sort, is frowned upon, and hair tends to either be close-cropped, or even shaved or else worn long, sometimes in elaborate tails, braids or buns.<div>Every warrior of the onikaze owns a daisho, the paired long and short swords of the samurai. These weapons are treated with the utmost reverence, for they are a reflection of the mage\u2019s honor and the vessel of his spirit. The various components that comprise the matched set of katana and wakazashi may be austere or elaborate in design, as befits the personality of their wielder (or that of the mentor who handed them down.)

Discipline, such would-be teachers reason, can be taught with time and harsh lessons, while the art of the blade is a study of an entire lifetime. Of note is the fact that many Wave-men flatly refuse to adopt women into the Legacy. To these sorts, the study of kenjutsu is men\u2019s work, not to be entrusted to a woman. This attitude is gradually subsiding with time, though particularly old (or especially hidebound) onikaze swordsmen look upon female practitioners of the Legacy with attitudes ranging from outrage to disgust to outright anger (sometimes expressed with drawn swords.)

However they do it, though, the master is urged, by his training and by his peers, to instill in the student a sense of self-reliance and adaptability.

But the truth of the matter is that the dragon is, at its core, a symbol of rage and terror. Indeed, in many ancient cultures, \u201cdragon\u201d is essentially synonymous with \u201cmonster\u201d or \u201cdevil,\u201d the embodiment of a savage and primordial hatred and hunger. So it is with those who walk the path of the Devourer, consuming the enemies of lost Atlantis and supping upon their power in the name of a greater good. But men are not meant to be as dragons, and so these practitioners of a law as timeless as it is inhuman have strayed far from the path of Wisdom, battening them upon hubris as surely as if it were the sweetest of marrow. </div><div>The Devourers of the Flesh are keepers of an old Legacy, one that they believe to dates back to the time before the Fall. While there exists no evidence to support such claims, there certainly is something primal and ancient in their hunger for the flesh, the atavistic urge toward a longing (or perhaps a need) forbidden by civilized traditions and Supernal commandments. Perhaps this age-old practice is reflected in many of the world\u2019s cannibalistic warrior cultures, whose beliefs are echoed and magnified in the brutal Devourers: in a very real way consuming the enemy\u2019s heart to take his strengths into oneself. </div><div>The practitioners of this Legacy claim to have been advance scouts and shock troops for Atlantis, going among the enemy\u2019s ranks and sowing the sort of terror that arises only from finding the half-eaten carcasses of one\u2019s people strewn between trees and over stones, glyphs of ill-omen painted in their congealing blood. While other Awakened who hear of this tale dismiss it as the self-serving propaganda of a fellowship of anthropophagic monstrosities, the Devourers wonder at the naivet\xe9 of those who can earnestly believe any truly great and powerful civilization of remote and ancient times to have balked at such practices in a world in which people were not so thoroughly conditioned to fear their own instincts. By stealing the power of Atlantis\u2019s enemies of old, the Devourers say, their spiritual forebears performed a service as vital as and, ultimately, far more natural than that practiced by the priests who read the stars or the scholars who kept the cavernous libraries of the island empire. </div><div>The so-called Cannibals (a title to which the Legacy\u2019s practitioners attach no sense of shame) consider themselves to be inheritors of a purer ethic than is found in the modern world. Just as every predator in nature hunts that which best sustains the predator and helps it to grow strong, so, too, do the Devourers allege that they consume the prey who empowers and uplifts them. Naturally, those who interact in any way with Awakened (or even just Sleeper) society must invariably attempt to conceal their practices, but this becomes increasingly difficult for most Devourers as time passes, Wisdom withers and dies and the willworker asks himself why it is that he hides his splendor from lesser beasts. Beyond such a point, these mages are already too far gone to salvage (if, indeed, one can consider redemption to be possible in the first place for a person who incorporates the consumption of his own kind into his very soul), and must be destroyed for the good of their world. Of course, some manage to escape, fleeing into the wilds \u2014 or perhaps just the most savage depths of the urban wilderness \u2014 there to perpetuate their philosophy of hunger. </div><div>Long considered to be a blight upon the otherwise upright reputation of the Adamantine Arrow, the Devourers of the Flesh have managed, nevertheless, to persist for at least centuries (and, quite possibly, far longer) without being utterly stamped out. The Legacy is laid low in one place, only to emerge elsewhere later, proving as persistent and resilient as the predators from which it derives its ghastly mandate. And, despite the reflexive fear and hatred of their fellow Arrows, Cannibals in the order continue to take their oaths to the Adamantine Arrow quite seriously. Indeed, many see themselves as the only true champions of the Adamantine Arrow\u2019s cause, imitating the dragon of old and consuming the power of Atlantis\u2019s enemies by fang and claw. Devourers don\u2019t tend to be impressive strategists, but they are certainly terrifying to behold on the battlefield, with the eldest and most potent dominating the engagement, lips and chins slick with hot blood, and the trophies of scores of kills dangling from hair, flesh and hand-sewn clothing alike.</div>",alternateNickname:"Cannibals",orders:"",appearance:"Devourers of the Flesh tend to either grow neglectful of their outward appearance \u2014 something of a manifestation of their rejection of social mores \u2014 or else take on a deliberately primordial, primitive seeming: simple tattoos and ritual scarification, filing down the teeth to points, wearing only furs and leathers, weaving bits of human bone into a long, matted tangle of hair.

That lore tells, too, of the many long journeys of Solomon and his periods of scholarly seclusion, during which the nameless apprentice stole into the chamber in which Asmodai was imprisoned. A heathen by birth, he was not bound by the Hebrews\u2019 religious law, and so sought to truly comprehend the terrible spirit his king had subjugated. Upon the occasion of the Sabaean\u2019s first visit, Asmodai, enraged at the youth\u2019s presumption, roared and bellowed and displayed many fearsome magics, but the intruder was unmoved. Instead, he asked, simply and without guile what was the source of the demon\u2019s great anger.

While Solomon toiled away at the staid lore of locking away his human nature, his apprentice studied in secret the arts of wresting self-mastery out of the gilded talons of indulgence. Sometimes the Warlock was educated through unearthly delights and, at other times, unimaginable torments. Eventually, however, Asmodai became concerned that the king suspected its rebellious behavior and bade the apprentice to flee Israel, taking with him all he had learned. When the young man expressed sincere concern for his mentor\u2019s fate, the demon smiled. \u201cWe are not born of men; our flesh is not your flesh. And yet, I see in you a spirit like my own, and so I name you an heir to my kingdom, shattered and incomplete. Go forth, my child, to preserve what I have shown you.

Upon first encountering these willworkers, Ahab\u2019s wrath was vast, and he resolved to destroy them and their heretical knowledge. While he went with murderous intent into the sanctum of those he most despised, the willworker emerged from that hidden place wise in the sorcery of Asmodai, and calling himself Ba\u2019al Hammon. To this day, none know for certain how it was that Ahab abandoned one Legacy for another; the Clavicularius claim he did so only through infernal magics, while the Bene Ashmedai maintain he was enlightened through his exposure to the demon\u2019s teachings. </div><div>Almost immediately, Ba\u2019al Hammon set out to ingratiate himself with the local powers within the Vox Draconis, to counter the inevitable backlash from those he had betrayed. His ploy earned the Warlock the protection of the Hierarch, who became one of his first students. Ba\u2019al Hammon was a prolific teacher, and he demanded that each of his apprentices adopt similar practices, until such a time as the numbers of what he came to call the Bene Ashmedai \u2014 the Children of Asmodai \u2014 were strong enough both to weather the enmity of the first Diabolist\u2019s former Legacy and to have something of substance to offer the Silver Ladder as an order. To counter the natural (and dangerous) desires engendered by such close communion with the demon within, Ba\u2019al Hammon set forth an unyielding policy of service for his disciples: through indulgence, they would make of Asmodai\u2019s lessons a beacon by which to light the way for the long, dark journey of the human soul. </div><div>On account of their founder\u2019s capable scheming, as well as not a little bit of luck, the Bene Ashmedai survived their tumultuous foundation and prospered within the Vox Draconis unto the modern day.

Perhaps it was in that age the Keepers of the Covenant first came to be, bridging the gap between mortal men and the gods who walked, unseen, throughout the world. Certainly there are none alive today who can point to the origin of the Legacy. Because of this, and because of their inextricable ties to the animistic and primordial Shadow, these willworkers know themselves as \u201cElders,\u201d and even to those who doubt the antiquity of their pedigree these mages often seem to possess old souls and they certainly wield old knowledge.</div><div>Strangely, even the Elders themselves are uncertain as to the specific nature of the \u201ccovenant\u201d described by the title of their Legacy; most of their lore, however, indicates it refers to the secrets of their Attainments, passed down to mortal willworkers by entities of the Shadow Realm.</div><div>Ancient records within the Silver Ladder tell of feats like those performed by the Keepers of the Covenant, often far outside the lands considered \u201ccivilized\u201d by city-dwellers. The Elders consider this to be evidence of the venerable age of their Legacy, as the majority of them have ever been far more at home in the wild places than among the works of men. As with the mages described in those old tales, the Keepers walk within the material and unseen worlds with equal facility, developing strange magics of Shadow and commanding the services of the spirits to be found there. Leaders and mystics among their people, as well as bastions of tradition and aspirants to the grandeur of the Supernal, they embody the primal majesty of the invisible world, tying their own destinies forever to that other plane.</div><div>But human beings \u2014 both Sleeper and Awakened \u2014 fear the things they do not understand, and the Keepers of the Covenant often became scapegoats for those of differing faiths. Their ways were labeled \u201cunclean\u201d and they were suspected of consorting with demons and other, far fouler things. The explosive spread of monotheistic religions, particularly Christianity, was the most grievous blow to be dealt to the Elders, whose membership was almost exclusively drawn from among peoples practicing a considerably different sort of relationship with the spiritual world. Before then, Keepers were often able to bring feuding parties to an equitable compromise; in the shadow of the Cross, however, when conversion by the sword became an acceptable practice, their magics were dealt with as unpardonable sins. Almost without exception, wherever the newcomers spread, the Elders of those regions came to seek out the th\xe9archs among their would-be saviors. While many Keepers were by that time Apostates or adherents to other orders, the majority remained faithful to the Vox Draconis, and they sued for peace on those grounds.</div><div>Some Elders found their entreaties fell on deaf ears, but the majority reestablished common ground with their brethren in the Silver Ladder. Though these alliances often did little to save the cultures from which those Keepers came, they did manage to preserve the Legacy itself and the secrets of the Keepers passed, perhaps for the first time, into the urban centers of Europe, North Africa and the Near and Middle East. As the great religious conflicts of the first millennium spilled into the second and time marched, mercilessly, onward, th\xe9archs were among those who sought out new lands. Some were deeply surprised to find Keepers of the Covenant scattered here and there among the indigenous peoples they encountered. The lore of these Elders, too, was incorporated into the knowledge the Vox Draconis had amassed, and many Keepers celebrated to learn their kin were to be found in every corner of the world. The oppression, exploitation and slow decimation of the majority of the civilizations in which these Elders thrived made this joy bittersweet at best, but, again, the beliefs and esoteric magics of the Legacy survived.</div><div>The stories told among the Keepers of the Covenant regarding the latter half of the second millennium are bleak: great leaders and magnificent societies laid low by disease, treachery and violence; persecution and enslavement; the slow eradication of ancient faiths. Some Elders stood their ground and perished, while others vanished into Shadow (sometimes with a handful of their people) and were never seen again by mortal eyes. For those who learned, however grudgingly, to assimilate, ignominy was their inheritance. Once proud and admired for their facility with the ways of Shadow, they became curiosities at best, and, at worst, objects of scrutiny, scorn and even hatred. For centuries, their numbers \u2014 never all that many to begin with \u2014 steadily declined, and the Keepers of the Covenant seemed doomed to extinction, their secrets to be forever lost to the Silver Ladder and to the Fallen World.</div><div>Modern accounts of the gathering that brought about a revival of the Elders in the early 20th century are both sparse and convoluted. Indeed, most such stories are mutually  contradictory. The rare few scholars within the Ladder who\u2019ve studied them to any degree note that the tales seem to be deliberately labyrinthine, so as to eliminate any possibility of piecing together the truth. On only one premise do they agree: a handful of Keepers from around the world, none of whom had ever met, contacted one another to assemble a Great Council and discuss the future of the Legacy, and the majority of Elders were somehow convinced to attend. Some records indicate a grand ritual was conducted, rearranging the skein of fate to perpetuate the Keepers of the Covenant. Others say the most skilled and powerful of the Elders all resolved to take on apprentices, regardless of their personal wishes, so that the Legacy\u2019s secrets would live on. Still others recount dire pacts with spirits, mysterious omens and the invocation of long-forgotten magics. Whatever the case, the Keepers of the Covenant enjoyed a resurgence, a movement aided only by the fits and starts with which the Western world gradually discovered scientific, scholarly and, every so often, spiritual interest in the values and practices of \u201ctraditional\u201d societies. Still by no means numerous, the Elders\u2019 numbers stand stronger in this day and age than they have for many years. Deep divisions and lingering wounds still hold some of them apart from their brothers and sisters in the Silver Ladder, but the majority of Keepers are content to enjoy this time of growth and renewal.</div>",alternateNickname:"Elders",orders:"",appearance:"Keepers of the Covenant don\u2019t often adopt any particular mode of dress; their spiritual beliefs don\u2019t usually call for a uniform of office.

Considering themselves to be almost minor lords of creation, these mages are able to move easily through life because they always have needed objects or cash on hand and few material obstacles can block their way. Known as Drifters, these mages are not prone to accept rules made by others. Instead, they see the world as something that is theirs to shape and alter as they will. Some care little about others, most are at least moderately compassionate, but few see any point in allowing anything other than their own choices and desires to dictate their actions.</p><p>The history of the Reality Makers is as unusual as their abilities and attitudes. They are an offshoot of the Sisterhood of the Blessed (see p. 174). During the mid 1920s, a cabal of the more progressively minded Blessed agreed to train a male mage who went by the name Utopian in their Legacy. However, word of the cabal\u2019s efforts reached the leaders of the Blessed, who regarded the idea of men among their number as a threat. So the cabal was ordered to cease training Utopian, who was then left with only a partial knowledge of the Blessed\u2019s first Attainment. One of the cabal\u2019s Sleepwalker servants, who had recently Awakened, joined him. She chose the Shadow Name Celesta and had hoped to be accepted in the Blessed until she noticed most members\u2019 attitude toward Utopian and also how the more conservative members reacted toward any members of lower class birth.</p><p>Together, Utopian and Celesta used the small bits of knowledge they had gained from the Blessed to create their own Legacy, one that used luck not as a tool for Byzantine manipulations, but simply as a way to allow members to more easily make their way in the world when they lacked the benefits of wealth and social class. To this, they added the ability to create objects out of nothing, an ability that proved exceptionally useful to poor mages seeking to advance themselves.</p><p>Members of this Legacy are commonly known as Drifters in large part because they believe a sufficiently able person should never need to exert herself except when she wishes to and that with enough skill and cleverness it is possible to bypass or eliminate any obstacle. For most Drifters, directly attacking an obstacle is both foolish and a mark of desperation.</p><p>Reality Makers seek to swiftly and easily bypass and avoid obstacles put before them and to reserve their attention for matters that interest them. The idea that there is any virtue in struggle or needless hard work is completely antithetical to members of this Legacy.</p><p>Instead, for them the best evidence someone is successful and worthy of respect is if this person never has to work at anything he does not enjoy. Reality Makers also believe no problem is insoluble and that skill and cleverness are far superior ways of solving problems than hard work or any similarly direct approach.</p><p>Although few discuss their feelings outside the Legacy, many Drifters sincerely feel they deserve to be treated well by the world and are completely entitled to all the benefits this Legacy provides. Some members feel they have some special destiny or purpose this Legacy will help them pursue. However, most are simply seeking wealth and power and regard finding the easiest and most elegant method of accomplishing these goals as the best possible choice.</p><p>Many mages find Drifters strange and even paradoxical, and often describe them as highly dedicated dilettantes or as being exceptionally ambitious in their laziness. To the Reality Makers themselves, there is no contradiction in their views, because they firmly believe success should come easily if one knows the right tricks to achieve it. While they can\u2019t precisely pull live rabbits out of hats, pulling fifty-dollar bills, high security ID badges or similar items out of their pockets is often far more useful.</p>",alternateNickname:"Drifters",orders:"",appearance:"Some Drifters prefer to use their abilities to fit in perfectly with their surroundings, while others prefer to stand out and impress those around them with their wealth and taste.

Most Drifters grew up believing they were either destined for greatness or just as entitled to the privileges of wealth and power as people who were born to it. Drifters are almost always as ambitious as most other members of the Silver Ladder, but their ambitions are usually purely personal and often involve finding a position of wealth, comfort and respect.</p><p>Some Reality Makers have other, somewhat darker ideas.

At that time, heavenly bodies were simultaneously objects of both scientific and mystical scrutiny, and even the most learned perceived no paradox in studying the motions of the stars as a scholar while also reading them for omens of the future. But the Stewards, as they are known today, were not, it seems, the creation of any renowned astronomer or celebrated mystic. Rather, they are the descendants of a mysterious and virtually unknown Theurgist who went only by the name Valeria. Modern Augurs, unfortunately, have no surviving records by which to know whether this was her real name, her Shadow Name, or merely an alias; only a scant few notes and that one name. Attempts by Stewards to study Valeria with the Time Arcanum have invariably met with failure, however, suggesting she may have gleaned secrets never handed down to her students.</div><div>The Augurs and the Silver Ladder were a natural fit for one another and the Stewards of the Celestial Orrery were soon absorbed into the order almost completely and without complaint on either side.

Those few Stewards who opted to go into other orders were closely watched (especially those who chose the Guardians of the Veil), but were permitted to go their way in peace. If any Augurs accepted the path of the Apostate, there exist no records of the Legacy to tell of them, and such sad hermits, if any, likely lived and died as nothing more than unsung historical curiosities.</div><div>The years following the Renaissance were good ones for the Stewards, whose knowledge of the flow of time enabled the Silver Ladder to make some meaningful gains throughout Europe\u2019s great age of colonization. The th\xe9archs of one or two particularly old Consilii in the New World claim the visions of the Augurs directly led to the settlement of Awakened colonists in the area. Some Stewards, calling upon their knowledge of the essential energies of magic, learned how to bring to life ancient machineries crafted by willwork scattered here and there in the places conquerors and missionaries first trod upon unknown shores. By the time the era of exploration began to draw to a close and the nebulous edges of the map became firm and inviolate, the Augurs were scattered all over the globe, following their prophecies and seeking to discern the inscrutable will of the Oracles of Atlantis.</div><div>As the 19th century drew to a close, however, an event the Stewards of the Celestial Orrery did not foresee came to pass: the creation of a self-proclaimed \u201cnew order\u201d in the Great Refusal of 1899. Mentors and students sought one another out, over even vast distances, and old colleagues corresponded on the contentious subject. In the end, none could explain this singular aberration, and the Augurs collectively determined the so-called \u201cFree Council\u201d was the direct result of a temporal error, the product of flawed causality, effectively, an idea that had no right to exist. The confidence of the Silver Ladder in its prophets was shaken, however, and the Stewards were thereafter no better or worse regarded, overall, than any other Legacy within the Vox Draconis. Still, the efforts of individual Augurs have, in the intervening years, greatly benefited cabals, Consilii and, occasionally, Awakened society on a wider scale, and so these willworkers are still esteemed for their divinatory powers, even if the Silver Ladder is no longer willing to take their predictions purely on faith.</div>",alternateNickname:"Augurs",orders:"",appearance:"For the most part, Augurs prefer to dress in stately, conservative styles when in public, often in ways that hint at civil or (especially) spiritual authority.

In private, however, fashion commonly gives way to comfort, though some Augurs opt to go so far as to attire themselves as ascetics when out of the public eye. When conducting rites (whether alone, within the Legacy, for members of the Silver Ladder, or for the Awakened community as a whole), Stewards often dress in elaborate robes suitable for the priesthood of lost Atlantis. Such garments tend to be richly embroidered and may depict glyphs in the High Speech, symbols indicative of the mage\u2019s Sleeper faith, if any, celestial bodies, scenes from Atlantean myth and/or other, similar imagery.",background:"Augurs are often drawn from those called to leadership within religious, spiritual or mystical hierarchies: ambitious clergy and ranking members of secret societies with metaphysical leanings, for instance.

At that time, across the American Midwest, Consilii, like Sleeper populations, trickled away and disappeared utterly as arable land withered and the dust storms closed in to devour the remains. Those were bleak times, hopeless times, and people did whatever they had to in order to escape from it, in whatever small ways they could.

He was good-looking, with a quick wit and an easy charm in the manner of many Acanthus. To the Awakened of his acquaintance he was called Lucius Nero, fiddling while the world as they knew it burned. Within the Silver Ladder he was regarded as a joker and a bit of a rogue, lining his threadbare pockets with the meager wealth of dustcaked yokels in exchange for a few hours of wonder and laughter. And, if one or two people went slowly mad in the wake of his passing, none were the wiser, for those were days in which crushing, endless sorrow took hold of many hearts and did not let go. To Nero\u2019s thinking, he gave a little bit of joy and he took a little something in return \u2014 a fair trade. </div><div>The truth of the matter is that Lucius Nero delved into many dark magics during his long circuits through the Dust Bowl, searching in vain for some way to rise above all the dying he saw and so desperately feared. Eventually he learned to steal the miraculous light that burns within every person and used those plundered spirits as the ante in his gamble to swindle the Reaper. Nero never found what he was looking for, but he did manage to transform himself into something else, something more than merely Awakened \u2014 something blasphemous. When the day at long last came that the dust stopped choking the nation, Lucius Nero, showman of the wasteland, chiseler of souls, was the first Charlatan of the Carnival Melancholy, and his was the power to extinguish the human spark in exchange for a wink and a nod from Lady Luck.

Following their own skewed view of the Elemental Precepts, the Charlatans see the Awakened as one nation in exile doing whatever is necessary to survive and prosper, while they themselves seize the Imperium Mysteriorum and ascend the Silver Ladder upon the backs of the Sleepers, dragging along their disincarnate souls as they walk the path toward the everlasting Supernal. </div><div>Some, as did their spiritual ancestor, Lucius Nero, still search for the secrets of immortality, but others are content merely to have their fun at the Fallen World\u2019s expense and to crack wise at the terrible grandeur of its bleakness until they choke on laughter and shuffle off the stage, smiling.

These mages had much more in common with their contemporary Banisher fellows than the more peaceful types who simply abandoned Atlantis. Those who refused to abandon Atlantis fought against the intrusion of magic into the world. They attacked magical constructs, destroyed repositories of magical knowledge and killed any mage they thought they could safely target. Although they disliked the use of magic, the Atlantean Banishers reluctantly concluded that it was necessary to use fire to fight fire. Citizens of Atlantis began to whisper about the traitors in their midst, calling them Timori, the feared, and the Banishers took up the name with pride. Eventually, the Timori cabals were uncovered by the Ungula Draconis and were either killed or forced into exile.</div><div>Various records of the Atlantean era speak of the armies of Atlantis marching against the poorly developed tribes and city-states of the time. These attacks are usually explained by Awakened scholars as a symptom of the hubris that lead to Atlantis\u2019s fall, but there are hints in the writings that suggest other possibilities. Here and there in the tales of the Atlantean armies\u2019 exploits, a determined researcher can see a pattern. Phrases that are routinely translated as \u201cAnd the fearful lived among the lesser people of the tribe and taught them to fear and hate us\u201d take on a different meaning when fearful is translated as feared. It certainly seems likely that exiled Timori raised Sleeper armies to attack Atlantean shipping and outposts. When viewed in this light, not every action taken by Atlantis against the primitive societies seems like such an overt act of hubris. </div><div>Years passed, and the Timori continued their harassment of Atlantean assets. Ungula Draconis teams sent out to deal with the Timori met with limited success, never managing to completely stamp them out. The Timori had resigned themselves to the idea that their battle might take centuries, when the first Mage War occurred. After celebrating their victory, the remaining mages of Atlantis raised their Ladder to the Heavens, and the worst nightmares of the Timori seemed to have come true.</div><div>The Timori sought meetings with the newly exiled mages, to convince them anew of the Timori\u2019s position. Reluctant at first to even speak to the Timori, let alone meet with them, the Exiles finally agreed to a temporary alliance when reality began to crack. Using the Sleeper armies of the Timori to assist, the Exiles took their fight back to Atlantis. While the Exiles fought their way up the Ladder into the Supernal, the Timori began to attempt to unravel the spells holding the Ladder together. Then came the explosion that sundered the world.</div><div>The majority of the Timori at ground zero of the explosion were killed instantly by the collapse of the Ladder. Those who survived wept in despair. Despite their best efforts, the natural order of the world was destroyed, seemingly for good. The Timori went to the leaders of the surviving exiled mages and begged them to give up magic.</div><div>\u201cLook,\u201d the Timori said, \u201cat what our power has wrought. This is the awful cost of magic!\u201d</div><div>The Exiles, not seeing how they could possibly survive without their magic, refused the Timori\u2019s entreaties and drove the Timori from them; the short alliance forever ended.</div><div>With the Awakened community scattered and the members of the Timori reduced to a mere handful, the Timori decided on a new course of action. It would be impossible for them to watch each new mage settlement, let alone stage successful attacks, at their current numbers. New Banishers who attempted to seek the Timori out for wisdom were also unlikely to survive such a quest if the Timori remained concentrated in one place. After much debate, a solution was agreed to; the Timori must become immortal. Only by avoiding the gaze of death did they have any chance at replenishing their numbers and continuing their battles.</div><div>The search for immortality was not a new idea for any mage community. Immortality was, indeed, one of the reasons the mages of Atlantis stormed the Supernal Realms. Abandoning, for now, their war against other mages, the Timori began to research how they could achieve their goal. Years stretched into decades as the Timori continued on their quest. The members of the cabal were growing older and older, and soon it turned into a race to see whether they could succeed in their task before they vanished from the Earth. Finally, the Timori discovered that the secret to immortality lay at the very core what makes a mage. They discovered that by ritually devouring Mana and Gnosis from a living host they could infuse their Patterns with enough raw magical energy to stop or even turn back the clock.</div><div>This solution delighted the Timori. It furthered their fight against mages and also ensured that if they were ever successful in completely eliminating magic from the world that, they, too, would then die. Newly empowered by their discovery, the Timori split their forces to ensure a large enough supply of Gnosis for each of them to survive and went back to war.</div><div>By the time the Feared began to prey on the fledgling magical communities, the Exiles believed the Feared to be long dead. The Exiles now blamed mage slayings on a group the Exiles called Banishers. Puzzled by this, the Timori investigated the Exiles\u2019 claims and discovered that the old order of peaceful naturalists had given way after the sundering. Those who might once have become like the Locust-Eater seemed driven by an almost instinctual fear and hatred of magic. The word Timori was now used exclusively to describe these new killers of mages, and the true Timori saw the advantage in maintaining in this belief.</div><div>Since the rest of the Awakened believed the more organized factions to be dead, the Timori hid themselves from view. They worked from the shadows, using Banishers as pawns, to divide mages from their cabals where they were more easily captured and their Gnosis harvested.</div><div>Such is the history claimed by those Timori who call themselves Feared. They allow other Banishers to cause an uproar, prodding and herding them in the proper directions, then swoop in to collect their prey. Every once in a while, a Banisher Awakens with more than the usual instinctive hatred of magic, and the Timori keep their eyes open for those rare individuals to train as apprentices. Though their numbers are still small compared to order mages, the number of Timori grows more often than it shrinks, setting the stage for the time when the Feared are ready to emerge from hiding and declare open war on the Awakened once more.</div>",alternateNickname:"The Feared",orders:"",appearance:"The Feared look just like everybody else \u2014 part of the reason for their success.

Merciless, fanatical and consumed by fear, their presence is said to herald the deaths of hundreds. Some believe that the Dreamers are corrupt victims of their own mystic energies, drawn helplessly to calamity and forced to inure themselves to the pain they witness. Others, however, know the Dreamers better: these mages are appalling engineers of disaster, slowly immolating themselves in the same fires that consume their victims. Power plant explosions, tunnel collapses, airplane and train crashes \u2014 all are projects of the Dreamers, and all are organized to empower their malicious works.</div><div>Founded in the dark days of the bloody Aztec Flower Wars, the Dreamers of the Black Sun are the priests and directors of a mystic organization now known as the Black Sun Cult. Spawned by the disillusioned, cynical instruction of a 13th-century Mastigos named Tochel, their teachings are a mishmash of Aztec and Atlantean lore, twisted by imperfect interpretation and willful misdirection.</div><div>Members of the Black Sun Cult believe that the mortal world is warped and corrupt by design \u2014 a misbegotten, chaos-laced creation built by hubristic, degenerate gods. In these mages\u2019 eyes, perversion is implicit in the design of every earthly object and inhabitant. A paradise once existed, they argue, and it was torn apart to provide the base material for the ruinous human world. This paradise is identified with Tamoanchan, the mythical Aztec world of Itzpapalotl, the great and terrible Obsidian Butterfly. The only survivors of its destruction are the demonic Tzitzimime, distorted spirits of vengeance bent on the annihilation of Earth. Trapped in the sky and hidden by the sun, they await the day of unending eclipse when they will drop to Earth and visit the righteous fury of their forgotten world on all of humanity.</div><div>The influence of the Black Sun Cult extends throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States. The cult members\u2019 presence is concentrated in urban centers, with little or no membership in rural or other, less populous zones. If reports are to be believed, though, individual cells have begun to travel outwards, appearing recently in surprising places: Brazil, Barcelona, even Tokyo. Whether these emergences indicate an expansion of the cult or a dispersion of existing membership is unknown to observers. </div><div>The Dreamers often communicate with spirits they identify as Tzitzimime, hearing their whispers from the rippling chaos of Pandemonium. To empower the agents of Tamoanchan and better receive their guidance (or even encourage their manifestation in the mortal world), the mages of the Black Sun Cult work to provide sacrifice on a grand scale, sabotaging structures and transport systems in an effort to murder dozens or hundreds of souls at once. These sacrifices are ritually prepared and carried out so as to channel energy to the Tzitzimime, providing them with the strength to slip their bonds and come to Earth. Eventually, the Dreamers hope, the energy gathered will be sufficient to bring about the day of unending eclipse and end the pain of life.</div><div>Black Sun magic makes use of the raw power of fear, ritually occluding conscious thought by immersing the practitioner in base terror and opening a conduit for the energies of Pandemonium to pass through. They call this \u201copening the bone passage,\u201d a practice that puts considerable physical strain on the mage. To help stimulate the effect, Dreamers often subject themselves to threatening circumstances with little or no guarantee of survival, trusting their own power to preserve them. Many actually remain at the site of a planned sacrifice (for instance, sitting as a passenger in an airplane that has been sabotaged), allowing themselves to participate in the tragedy and risk becoming its victims. The heightening of fear that precedes the event often provides them with enough power to survive once it begins \u2014 but not always.</div><div>Their pursuit of fear is not always fueled by magical study, though. Some of the members of the Legacy become addicted to the sensation so essential to their workings, noting that they become bored and listless without the extreme stimulus they are accustomed to. Many turn to masochistic practice, pushing themselves further and further into the world of self-inflicted pain in an attempt to chase the adrenal high of panic.</div><div>The Dreamers were once a minor Legacy with relatively little influence in the mortal world. Among the Aztecs, the Dreamers were a death cult without the power to match their rivals, constantly at risk of complete destruction. Even in modern nights, their numbers are too few and their practice too dangerous to allow functional long-term organization. Turnover is frequent in the cult, and on average, the Dreamers lose members faster than they gain them. Only the dedication of a few surviving tutors has kept the Legacy alive at all. However, the advents of mass transit and modern weaponry have made it relatively easy for smaller numbers to have a greater overall impact. Even with a dwindling membership, the cult is achieving larger and more frequent sacrifice, leading to thousands of mortal deaths in recent years. To lend some perspective to the threat they now embody, enemies of the cult have noted that energies harvested by the Black Sun mages during the last 10 years may well surpass those gathered during the whole of the preceding century.</div><div>Because of the mages\u2019 activities, the cult\u2019s enemies often make a point of hunting down and neutralizing the Dreamers of the Black Sun. The practices of the cult are abhorrent to outsiders and cannot be tolerated in good conscience. While the Dreamers don\u2019t make a policy of seeking conflict with their own kind, individual members can become quite enthused about the battles that come their way, finding great satisfaction in deadly magical conflict.</div><div>It\u2019s true that the Dreamers are not entirely unredeemable. Individual cases of repentance and rejection of the values of the Black Sun Cult have been reported, lending hope to those who seek a peaceful means to end their crimes. Former members often become great crusaders against the actions of their Legacy, working tirelessly to end its murderous activities. The cult itself cares little about losing members, and makes no effort to pursue its former adherents.</div><div>And yet, the organization still survives. One by one, new mages add their power to the Black Sun cause, regardless of the dangers involved. The tutors of the Legacy find disenfranchised students, drawing them into the teachings of Tamoanchan. The Dreamers may be few, but their fervor is intensifying, as if distilled.

By focusing the energy that courses over the Earth, the ancients were able to influence natural and unnatural occurrences wherever the energy flowed. They could cause crops to produce untold harvests, or create blight that led to starvation and death. They could inspire wisdom and understanding or fuel depravity and breed despair.

More likely, Vespasian noticed which way the wind was blowing for Prince Henry \u2014 in late May of 1420, the prince was named governor of the Order of Christ (heir to the Templars in Portugal) and thus gained access to a great deal of wealth. Vespasian, having knowledge to the prince\u2019s monetary doings, would have known that this appointment was coming, and decided to get the Silver Ladder\u2019s backing in staying close to the prince. Whatever the truth, Vespasian accomplished his goal. Six other mages joined his nascent cabal.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Celestial Cartographers</h3><div>These seven mages (the six Vespasian recruited plus Vespasian himself) formed a cabal called the Cart\xf3grafos Celestiais \u2014 \u201cthe Celestial Cartographers.\u201d Vespasian tried to establish himself as leader of the cabal, but soon found himself overshadowed by a younger and more idealistic mage called Daedalus. Daedalus, a Moros, never openly questioned Vespasian\u2019s motives, but did keep the cabal focused on its goal of discovery and ascent to the stars. Vespasian realized that he would be better off providing monetary support than trying to be a philosophical center for the cabal, and faded into the background. He died from natural causes, circa 1450, but the cabal flourished. Many of the voyages planned and sponsored by Prince Henry included either a member of the cabal or one of the proximi in service to it, and Daedalus, a Master of Space as well as Matter, always saw to it that the cabal member returned, even from a disastrous voyage.</div><div>Prince Henry died in 1460, and Daedalus vowed to carry on the Navigator\u2019s dream of mapping the stars. He formed a new Legacy, which he threw open to any member of the Silver Ladder (and later tutored at least one Moros of the Mysterium). This Legacy, which took the name \u201cCelestial Navigators\u201d after Prince Henry, focused on exploration and mapping of new and strange lands. Some members of the Legacy accompanied ships to new countries (one, in fact, sailed on the Santa Maria with Christopher Columbus, but abandoned him after returning from his first voyage, calling him \u201ca pig, a buffoon, and an opportunist \u2014 he doesn\u2019t see people, he sees piles of gold\u201d). Some entered the Shadow and attempted cartography and cataloging of the spirit worlds, with varying degrees of success. Some attempted to use descriptions of fables such as Prester John\u2019s kingdom or the Fountain of Youth to open scrying windows or portals, but if any of these attempts succeeded, there are no records. The Legacy spread, and when Daedalus died, he did so knowing that he had inspired the hopes and dreams of many of the Awakened.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Made of Stars</h3><div>The Celestial Navigator Legacy remained a fairly important one in Europe (and, if rumors are to be believed, in China as well) up until the early 17th century. As exploration changed from over sea to over land, the Legacy became less common. The Silver Ladder kept records, of course, and there were still Celestial Navigators to be found, especially in southern Portugal, but it wasn\u2019t until the formation of the Free Council that the Legacy experienced a revival.</div><div>In 1899, when the Free Council emerged as an order, the Silver Ladder was not initially enthusiastic. But one member of the Vox Draconis who supported the nascent order was a physicist named Dr. John Cressner. Gauge, as he was known to his fellow mages, believed the Free Council was a natural progression, an ideological evolution of sorts, responding both to needs within the Awakened community and changes to the Fallen World. Gauge, wishing to formally welcome the Free Council to the Awakened community of his home city (New York), found the records detailing the Celestial Navigators Legacy and presented them to the Free Council. He made a special point of mentioning that Prince Henry the Navigator\u2019s dream of mapping the stars had not yet been realized, but perhaps that was unimportant \u2014 the dream itself was what had led to the Legacy. Gauge, himself an Obrimos, never joined a Legacy at all, but his gesture didn\u2019t go unnoticed. Mages in the Free Council looked over the old writings and learned rotes and history that helped in their dealings with the Ladder. Mages of the Ladder, meanwhile, studied the notes and decided that the Celestial Navigators\u2019 philosophy might be worthy of study again, especially in light of Gauge\u2019s speech about conversion and progression.</div><div>Some years later, a cabal of mages from the Free Council and the Silver Ladder approached Gauge and asked him to collaborate on a series of magical experiments performed in conjunction with the theories of quantum mechanics. Gauge, himself an expert in the field of harmonics, agreed, and the cabal made some fascinating discoveries. Matter, they realized, was energy, and while it had long been known that a skilled mage could change energy to solid matter and back, the cabal became convinced that with the right apparatus, this conversion was possible in the Fallen World as well. In 1926, the cabal renamed itself the \u201cPhotonic Navigators,\u201d taking the term \u201cphoton\u201d from the work of American chemist Gilbert Lewis. Their intent was to learn to convert living matter to energy and thus travel to places unreachable even by mages.</div><div>Some of these mages, adapting the teachings of the Celestial Navigators Legacy, created a variant \u2014 the Celestial Masters. Since then, the Legacy has recruited from the Silver Ladder, the Free Council, and accepts Necromancers from other orders as well. They continue to work toward better understanding of energy conversion, hoping to one day be able to reproduce their magical feats without using magic. They recognize, though, that this goal might be impossible. This, to the Stargazers, isn\u2019t important. The important thing is that their goal continues to inspire them, and allows them to do great things along the way.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>The Celestial Masters Legacy is one of the more accessible, given that two orders and a Path teach it. Joining requires finding a Celestial Master and making an entreaty. A background in physics isn\u2019t strictly necessary, but applicants are required to have reached the rank of Apprentice in both Matter and Forces, and to demonstrate skill in conversion in both Arcanum.</div><div>The applicant is then required to study with his mentor, learning at least two of the following rotes (all page numbers refer to Mage: The Awakening): Alter Conductivity (p. 194), Influence Light (p. 162), Invisible Object (p. 166) or Transmute Water (p. 197). The mage also studies physics, alchemy and philosophy during this training period.</div><div>The mentor may terminate training at any time if he feels the pupil isn\u2019t cut out for the Legacy. At the end of the training time, the mentor makes a decision as to whether the pupil is a good match. If he feels the mage will be a good addition to the Legacy, the two of them go on a trip to Sagres, visit the grave of Prince Henry, and discuss the philosophy of reaching for the stars. That evening, the mage reshapes his soul and formally becomes a Celestial Master.</div>",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"Initially, the Legacy\u2019s attainments used Space as the primary Arcanum.

The first is an increase in the character\u2019s visual range, allowing him to see a number of miles equal to (Gnosis x 3). Activating this Attainment requires the player to roll Wits + Composure + Science. The character can terminate the spell at any time, but while the spell is activated, the player suffers a \u20134 modifier to any sight-based Perception rolls to notice something in the character\u2019s immediate area (hearing and scent are unaffected, of course, and the mage might use a Space spell to warn her if anyone approaches). While the Attainment doesn\u2019t mitigate darkness by itself, the Stargazer can cast the Forces spell \u201cNightsight\u201d and see for miles in the dark.</div><div>The second effect is similar to the Matter 2 spell \u201cSteel Windows.\u201d The character can look through any solid object he wishes.

The mage can touch a wall and make it disappear in a flash of light, or mute the report from a gun by making the sound dissipate into a splash of water. He cannot, however, transmute energy into energy or matter into matter, change energy into air (or vice versa), or transmute kinetic energy or radiation. The only types of energy he can use with this Attainment are light, heat, sound, electricity and fire, and the only types of matter he can involve are solids and liquids. All transmutations are permanent, and the mage cannot shape matter using this Attainment. For instance, he might change light into stone, causing the room to darken momentarily and small chunks of stone to fall to the ground, but he couldn\u2019t take the light in the room and turn it into a statue (not with this Attainment alone, at least, though spells might make this possible).</div><div>The conversion from energy to matter is problematic, because gauging how \u201cmuch\u201d light or sound might transform into a gallon of water or a pound of stone is difficult.

This Attainment requires a flat space and a good source of energy (light, sound, energy or fire will all suffice, but the simplest method is probably to use this Attainment during the day and use sunlight). The mage must have a sympathetic connection to a nearby object. He enters a trance, meditating upon the object and all of the energy and matter in between himself and it. As he mediates, the energy source becomes a solid, 3-D model of the terrain between the mage and the targeted object. The model only records stationary objects, so people and moving cars aren\u2019t recorded, but the level of detail is otherwise superb (street signs are visible, swimming pools are actually full of water, and so on).

As far back as the Reformation, certain mages worked closely within the Church (and outside of it, probably, but the most reliable records come from priests and monks) to help \u201cilluminate\u201d the souls of the un-Awakened. These mages variously called themselves \u201cguides,\u201d \u201cmuses,\u201d and sometimes even \u201cPrometheans,\u201d after the Greek Titan who brought fire to mortals (this title is almost never used in the modern era).</div><div>The Illumined Path adopted its name and a formal set of precepts in the early 20th century. A Lutheran priest began the journey to Awakening, but faltered somewhere along the way and wound up trapped within his own mystery play. A Thyrsus mage called Daniel, using a protracted Spirit spell, found his lost soul and brought it back to his body. The priest remembered little of the experience, but did recall seeing \u201ca light, a beckoning light that led me back.\u201d After that, he was able to see magic without succumbing to Disbelief, and became a trusty ally of Daniel\u2019s cabal. The cabal, in fact, dedicated themselves to helping other Sleepers see past the Lie. The priest acted as spiritual counselor and advisor to the mages, and it was he who provided the phrase that has since defined the Illumined Path: \u201cTo give light to those who sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death\u201d (Luke 1:79).</div><div>The cabal never referred to itself as \u201cthe Illumined Path.\u201d Instead, that phrase referred to their set of philosophical and magical precepts (see below). Over time, Daniel and the rest of the cabal learned that Sleepers were capable of seeing magic and Supernal Truth more often than most mages gave them credit for. The un-Awakened normally didn\u2019t understand what they were seeing, but they responded instinctively to threats even when they couldn\u2019t identify the source. The cabal felt that this kind of instinct was what granted humanity an inherent sense of morality. People knew that hurting others was \u201cwrong\u201d because they perceived the inherent harmony of the universe and wanted to be part of it. Those who were willing to hurt others, or, worse, took pleasure in it, did so because they were especially blinded by Quiescence.</div><div>But then the cabal received a fatal blow to its philosophy \u2014 World War I. Daniel, a young man at the time that war broke out, entered the Army hoping to spread his teachings to soldiers on both sides. Instead, he met his end in France, gunned down in a muddy field. His magic was no match for machine gun fire. Back in the United States, his cabal read the reports of what was happening in Europe, and fell to despair. People, it seemed, had no sense of peace or harmony, or if they did, it was quickly eroded when the trumpets of war sounded.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Revival</h3><div>It was Daniel\u2019s grand-nephew, Graham Benedine, who revived the Illumined Path in 1982. Graham found Daniel\u2019s Bible while rummaging through a box in his mother\u2019s attic one day. He sat down and read the notes that Daniel had written to himself, took note of the underlined passages, and marveled at the strange symbols that were not English, and yet seemed to mean something, though Graham could not put his finger on what it was. Never a particularly religious man, Graham was still fascinated by his great-uncle, the philosopher, and made a list of the notes Daniel had written and the passages he\u2019d marked, in order. What he discovered, with a little interpretation, was the Illumined Path.</div><div>Graham, of course, knew nothing of Awakened magic, but he saw the philosophy as meaningful anyway. Enlightenment, as he read it, was something that couldn\u2019t be given, but could benefit from guidance. The Illumined Path rejected notions of preaching, or a master-student relationship, and instead summed up its position with a parable:</div><div><i>We are all lost in a dark wood. Sometimes, one of us finds the edge, and is free and safe. That man then has the choice: does he leave the rest of us to our fate? Does he feel it is our responsibility to find our own way? Does he lie in wait, hoping to trap us for his own benefit? Or does he re-enter the woods, hoping to guide us out?</i></div><div><i>Likewise, some of us lost here have light. Do we hide our light, selfishly guarding it? Are we so afraid that others will stomp it out, out of fear, out of hate, out of desperation? No. Our lights must lead others on, for light begets light. Once others are drawn to us, we must show them how to light their own way. This is the Illumined Path.</i></div><div>Graham wrote a book entitled \u201cThe Illumined Path,\u201d espousing his great-uncle\u2019s philosophies. It was published, but never sold very well. The Legacy, of course, uses Graham\u2019s book as their bible.</div><div>Graham never Awakened, and died in 1990. Officially, his death was of natural causes, but the Legacy believes he was murdered by magic, probably by the Seers of the Throne (but, some speculate, just as easily by the Guardians of the Veil). Shortly after his death, a group of mages (mostly Shamans) who had read and been inspired by his book came together and formed a cabal. A few years later, the Legacy was born. The Illumined Path has refused to name the first member of the Legacy. When asked who the founder of the Illumined Path is, they refer to the unnamed priest whom Daniel guided out of the \u201cdark wood\u201d so many years ago.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Philosophy</h3><div>The Legacy\u2019s philosophy, as explained by Daniel and later Graham, is as follows:</div><ul><li><b>Varying degrees of light:</b> One is not \u201cAwakened\u201d or \u201cAsleep.\u201d The ability to perceive magic is a spectrum. A \u201cSleepwalker\u201d is in the middle of the spectrum, a mage is closer to one extreme, but a \u201cSleeper\u201d can be led to enlightenment (if not Awakening), and a mage can be led to great insight.</li><li><b>Lead, do not preach:</b> There is no value in abusive teaching. The Guides do not beat their students, and they do not put them through demeaning or hurtful lessons. The world teaches pain and suffering enough, and the Legacy\u2019s members do not wish to make it worse.</li><li><b>The soul is the brightest light:</b> A person who has damaged his soul must be healed. A mage that traffics in souls is the worst kind of blasphemer and traitor to the Light. And yet, if his soul can be healed, that is the greatest good.</li><li><b>Recognize the moment of the spark:</b> Any Sleeper can be made into a Sleepwalker \u2014 or even Awakened \u2014 by witnessing magic at the right moment. This moment might be defined by crisis, introspection, or even random chance, but if a Pathfinder can show a Sleeper something magical, be it a vulgar spell, an Artifact, or even a supernatural occurrence unconnected with Awakened magic, she can open that Sleeper\u2019s soul to a bit more light.</li><li><b>Master Paradox:</b> Mages can prevent Paradox with magic. They can cope with the results, but the damage it can do to their bodies is great. The Illumined Path feels that allowing Paradox to eat away at their bodies is wrong. Every mage must make his own choice about Paradox, but fear of it only empowers it.</li></ul><div>This last tenet is one that the Legacy argues about even today. Daniel, apparently, was notorious for letting Paradox run free, and wound up Branded more than once. Some suspect, in fact, that a Paradox was what killed him on the battlefield. The Illumined Path feels that releasing Paradox, rather than containing it, is generally preferable. It\u2019s just not always practical, especially in a combat situation.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Induction </h3><div>Joining the Illumined Path is nominally a matter of reading Graham\u2019s book and dedicating oneself to the philosophies therein, which means anyone, even a Sleeper, can do it. Joining the actual Legacy is a little more involved, of course. Once the supplicant has read the book, she must seek out a tutor and present her request. Thus far, only Thyrsus mages have joined the Legacy, but no specific policy on the part of the Illumined Path restricts it to Shamans.</div><div>If the tutor agrees to take on the pupil (and the tutor is left to his own devices for determining suitability), the apprenticeship usually takes a month or two. During this time, the tutor and student find ways to extend guidance to others, hopefully in a way that makes Sleepers more aware of magic without violating the Lex Magica. Often this involves interacting with mortals on a spiritual level and helping to foster perception of the unseen.

They look to figures both historical and mythological as their teachers: Mimir, whose severed head advised Odin; William Rankine, the Scottish physicist who coined the term \u201cpotential energy;\u201d and Lao Tzu, the Chinese Taoist philosopher. The Advisors, as they are often known, concern themselves with gathering knowledge, with learning everything they can, but with acting in accordance with their instincts and intuition.

They operate under a strict code of non-aggression (not necessarily non-violence, however), and the vows of the Legacy preclude turning aside someone that asks for their help. The vows also preclude lying, however, and this places the Legacy at risk should a Sleeper ever ask a question with a potentially damaging answer. When asked about this, an Advisor admits that the best solution is simply to avoid being faced with those kinds of questions. The Voice must be prepared to face consequences from either the mortal law or the Lex Magica, if keeping her vows means violating those laws.</div><div>Above all, Mimir\u2019s Voice strives to help others \u2014 mage and Sleeper alike \u2014 learn. But teaching isn\u2019t a matter of explanation and lecture, not if one wants the lesson to sink in. Ask any teacher; the only lesson a student really learns is the one that he wants to learn, and so education is less about presenting fact and more about instilling a desire to become knowledgeable and an understanding of how to learn. The Legacy, therefore, amasses knowledge and waits to be asked for it. The Advisor is potential energy, and that energy is knowledge, magic, and even moral guidance.</div>",alternateNickname:"Advisors",orders:"As mentioned, the Mysterium boasts the greatest number of Advisors, but this has more to do with the founder of the Legacy being a mystagogue than the Legacy\u2019s beliefs fitting neatly into the order. The members of the order share stories of the quiet, somewhat strange mages of the Voice, and occasionally someone hears of it and decides it would be a good fit. The Free Council also has a few Advisors among its members, as the Legacy\u2019s modern origins and interest in energy, to say nothing of its altruistic and egalitarian views, make it attractive to the youngest order.<div>The Adamantine Arrow appreciates the Legacy\u2019s desire to help and serve others, but sees it as a bit too pacifistic, in general.

The Advisors, of course, feel that says much about the Guardians and the way they train their members.</div><div>The Silver Ladder, like the Guardians, doesn\u2019t object to the Advisors, but usually the Ladder would rather see others in an advisory role.

A mage is required to have a certain degree of peace with herself, as is a great deal of maturity and humility, before she can be a successful Advisor.

Within a Consilium, an Advisor is likely to take an assistive role, perhaps acting as Herald or, within the Mysterium, as Censor or assistant to the Censor. Advisors might rise in Consilium Status without trying to, as other mages come to them for advice or help. Advisors also often wind up knowing things that the other people wish they did not, and since they don\u2019t keep secrets, the Voice ends up on the wrong end of assassination attempts more frequently than they\u2019d like.

The first member of the Legacy was a Warlock of the Mysterium named Elle. Elle was offered the position of Censor in her city\u2019s Consilium, and accepted, but was surprised at how much effort the mages of the city seemed to put into making sure that she kept certain facts from their rivals. After a year in the position, she announced her policy \u2014 she would never deny information to anyone who asked, but she would not offer information under any circumstances. She remained in sight (and effectively became second-in-command to the Hierarch, though she would never have referred to herself as such), but largely remained silent. Asking her for advice was a good way to draw attention to oneself, because then other mages became interested in what the querent wanted to know... and Elle refused to keep secrets. The atmosphere of transparency created in the Consilium was beneficial, for a while, but Elle died mysteriously after three years in her position. During that time, she had passed along her new Legacy. She never named it, but her pupil, a young man named Gjallarhorn (after the drinking horn that Odin used to drink from Mimir\u2019s well), viewed the Legacy as the perfect advisors, and chose the name according to his own sensibilities. Unfortunately, he lacked his mentor\u2019s patience and her unwavering commitment to honesty, and before long he was keeping secrets for some people and providing private information on others. The Consilium suffered a collapse from the infighting, during which many of the older mages left the area, and has only now begun to recover (Gjallarhorn now acts as Hierarch for the area).</div><div>Mimir\u2019s Voice spreads slowly, and enjoys its largest membership within the Mysterium. It is not strictly an order Legacy, however, and some Consilii (mostly surrounding the one that bore witness to the rise and fall of Elle and Gjallarhorn) are home to a quiet, polite and extremely approachable Advisor. </div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Joining Mimir\u2019s Voice isn\u2019t easy, but it is faster than many other Legacies. The Voice doesn\u2019t ask for long periods of apprenticeship or extensive testing periods. It does, however, ask that members of the Legacy be morally sound, almost impeccable. A mage attempting to join the Voice must submit to a long interview with many ethical quandaries, as well as magical probing to determine whether the answers she gives are indicative of her true feelings. The interview process is meant to gauge what the mage\u2019s intuition is telling her, and whether those intuitive urges are compatible with the Legacy. A mage whose first thought when faced with a potentially violent situation is to contribute to the violence probably should look elsewhere, but a mage whose first impulse is to defuse the situation is perhaps a better match. Interestingly, a mage who responds with fear to violence is often given preferential treatment, because such a mage is responding in a perfectly appropriate manner. The second part of the question, though, is what action the mage takes.</div><div>No action at all is often an appropriate response. The Legacy often recounts the story of the man who is thrown from a horse, breaking his arm and receiving sympathy from a neighbor...only to discover that because of his injury, he cannot be conscripted into battle where he will surely die. The mages of Mimir\u2019s Voice don\u2019t advocate standing idly by while people suffer, but they do ask their members to recognize that suffering has a place, too. What is acceptable suffering, and when is action \u2014 magic \u2014 required? Those questions don\u2019t have correct answers, and a mentor in Mimir\u2019s Voice strives to help her pupil consider the question and act with confidence, rather than act rashly.</div><div>The prospective Advisor is admonished to consider her motives in whatever action she takes. Anger, hatred, jealousy and other such emotions are easy to label as \u201cbad,\u201d but the truth is that they are intuitive, just as compassion, love and mercy can be. Indeed, it\u2019s not impossible for an action to be motivated by both envy and compassion, by both justice and anger. And if an action is just, but still motivated by anger, is that action then wrong? Mimir\u2019s Voice believes that action motivated by emotion (\u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d) isn\u2019t necessarily wrong, but might be diluted. Instead, they advise learning one\u2019s own patterns, learning what kind of \u201cenergy\u201d one is storing up, and being self-aware enough to recognize one\u2019s typical reactions.</div><div>Once the interview is over, the Advisor makes a decision. That decision might be to induct the new mage, to refuse her request, or to delay the answer to gather further information. The Advisor might invite the prospect to join her cabal for a short time, or to apprentice with her so that she can observe the character. She might also ask for permission to use Space magic to look in on the mage from time to time, just to see what she does in different situations.</div><div>If the mage is accepted into the Legacy, she is expected to learn and swear to the Code. This oath isn\u2019t magically enforced, because backing it up with a spell would imply that the Code isn\u2019t worth following by itself (and might also back a mage into a corner where the letter of the law is concerned \u2014 the letter is much less important than the spirit). The Code isn\u2019t brief and it isn\u2019t simple, but if the mentoring mage has chosen a pupil well, the Code is intuitive.</div><div>Once the mage swears the Code, the mentor shows her how to reshape her soul for the Legacy. Advisors often state that the sensation of becoming a member of Mimir\u2019s Voice is soothing, as though external sound and sensation suddenly dampens or moves far away. They feel energized, but not restless \u2014 ready for action, should action become necessary.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Code of Mimir\u2019s Voice</h3><div>The Code isn\u2019t a list of rules and laws, but is a philosophical work composed of parables, examples and maxims. Following is an excerpt:</div><div>Rudeness has no place. If a Voice cannot think of a way to contribute to a conversation, if a Voice cannot conceive of something to say that can teach \u2014 and remember that to teach, we must make the pupil want the lesson \u2014 then the Voice must be silent....</div><div>Aggression is dangerous. If your intuition says to attack, consider why? Who benefits from your injury? If you die, what will you leave behind? If you kill, what then? What have you removed from the world? If you choose non-aggression, protecting where protection is needed but abstaining from violent action otherwise, you are better assured of remaining unblemished....</div><div>In casting spells, remember that your intuition guides the magic as much as your will. Witness the mage whose Nimbus flares to life and scours the ground around him with fire or ice or acid or harsh words or hatred. What is that mage\u2019s intuition? Is it an extension of the hate in his heart? What is in your heart, and what does your magic reveal about you? If you act in harmony with your intuition, if you train your intuition to guide you well, you can ease the world in its myriad transitions, rather than change it with a jarring, aggressive push....</div><div>If someone comes to you and asks for your help, grant it. Do not waste time determining if this person deserves your help. You might be able to make that determination by looking into the person\u2019s mind or soul, yes, but by doing so, you are cheapening their request for your aid. Asking for help is a monumental act of trust, and you should always honor that. If, in helping this person, it comes to your attention that the person is a criminal or a monster, you must act as your intuition guides you. If your intuition tells you not to help someone who asks, though, consider why. Is the person lying about why he needs the help? If so, help him anyway, and your example will show him that not everyone sees the world as he does. Is the person trying to harm you or find a way to rob you? If so, help him anyway, and keep your wits about you, always ready to escape or protect yourself, for you, as a mage, are able to protect yourself and another victim might not be. Is the person asking you for help solely because he knows you will grant it without question? Help him, and rejoice, for you are living the Code.</div><div>Mages living by the Code often have high Wisdom ratings, usually 7 or more. Of course, not every Advisor lives strictly by the Code, and some feel that paying attention to intuition means knowing when to ignore the Code. This attitude is not at all in line with Elle\u2019s philosophies, but Elle is gone, and so her words are subject to interpretation.</div>",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"<div>The Attainments of Mimir\u2019s Voice are based on the concept of potential energy, the notion that substances or objects have within them the capacity for power.

Before life was the way it was, there was a paradise, a land of ease and comfort, of beauty and pleasure. And then, usually due to some failing on the part of mankind, it all fell apart, and people were forced to hunt, mate, hurt and die. The fact that this myth is so widespread leads the Awakened to surmise that there must be some truth to it \u2014 indeed, they tie these uber-myths to their own story of the Fall of Atlantis. The Celestial Ladder shattered and the Awakened City was lost forever. The Orders of the Pentacle (rather, four of them) claim to be all that remains of this \u201ctime before.\u201d</div><div>The Roses of Eden don\u2019t dispute this. They just think it\u2019s pathetic.</div><div>The Roses of Eden are mages that denounce the Pentacle, and the Atlantean paradigm in general. It isn\u2019t that they claim Atlantis never existed \u2014 certainly the temples and Artifacts, to say nothing of phenomena such as ananke, indicate that some civilization of mages predated known history. What the Roses object to is basing the current, modern-day society of the Awakened on a society about which so few concrete facts are known. After all, mages are aware that the Seers of the Throne take their orders (or at least inspiration) from ancient, ascended masters \u2014 why, then, do the Pentacle mages insist on doing the same thing? Oracles or Exarchs, it doesn\u2019t matter. Both are inscrutable, both are unknowable, and both are not of the Fallen World. Better, surely, to create a new society, one truly born of the modern era.</div><div>The Legacy\u2019s members are aware that their philosophies aren\u2019t popular, and so most of them try to meet other mages\u2019 concerns as reasonably and gently as possible. This is especially true of the Noddists, who once claimed membership in one of the orders but left after the labyrinthine politics and rampant nepotism disillusioned them. Yes, the orders have safeguarded important secrets through the centuries \u2014 rotes, magical practices, mudras, mystic items and locations \u2014 and those should all be preserved. But isn\u2019t it time to cast off the rivalries of the past?</div><div>Some Noddists, however, are openly hostile to the orders. They might be able to work with order mages, or even to join their cabals, but they refuse to take membership. Some even refuse to claim membership in a Consilium, but most Roses admit that it just isn\u2019t practical to try to make a life as a mage without the protection and support of other mages.</div><div>Perhaps most controversial of all, some Roses cultivate contact with sorcerers whose power doesn\u2019t come from the Supernal Realms at all. Not all magic is Awakened in nature, and while most mages seem to feel that any magic that doesn\u2019t directly stem from an Awakening is an inferior or even stolen version of their own power, the Roses of Eden view all magic as having a place in their ideal society. The Fallen World is a dangerous place, and having allies that don\u2019t suffer Paradox or engender Disbelief can only benefit the Awakened, even if their powers aren\u2019t as versatile. The Roses of Eden haven\u2019t made a great deal of progress toward establishing their society yet, largely because they have thousands of years of Atlantean tradition to break through. In some Consilii (notably those with a heavy Free Council presence), the Roses have succeeded in doing away with some of the tradition offices. Instead of a Hierarch, a visiting cabal might find a Committee, or even a President, elected for a short time by the mages of the city. Rumor has it that one city\u2019s mages even collectively renounced their order membership and pledged themselves to the Roses of Eden. This city (the exact location varies depending on who is telling the tale and why) lost all of its mages over the next six weeks, and now no Consilium at all remains. The more militant Roses of Eden have their theories about what really happened, but the moderate members of the Legacy doubt the veracity of the story.</div>",alternateNickname:"Noddists",orders:"Obviously, the Roses of Eden aren\u2019t popular with any of the four orders that claim to derive from Atlantis. The Free Council is often favorably disposed toward the Legacy (and officially, it\u2019s the only order to which the Noddists are allowed to belong), but not always. In some areas, Free Council mages are either loyal to the Pentacle or marginalized to the point that they have little concept of their order\u2019s identity. The Roses of Eden looks upon the former with scorn, but on the latter with hope \u2014 those mages are ripe for recruitment to the cause.",appearance:"A slight majority of the Roses of Eden is female, but this isn\u2019t a matter of policy so much as a reflection that many Consilii still favor men.

Beyond that, they don\u2019t put restrictions on who may join as a matter of policy, but each individual Noddist is left to her own devices on whom to take on a pupil, and not all Noddists have the same priorities. One might look at the Legacy as a way to forcibly bring down the established Consilium structure, and recruit a mage with experience in urban warfare. Another might take a more tolerant approach and try to bring the system down by exposing it \u2014 a reporter, then, might make for a good pupil.<div>As a faction or an ideological movement, the Roses of Eden don\u2019t discriminate.

After Eve ate from the Tree of Knowledge, God laid a curse on Adam that (among other things) plants would have thorns and thistles. Roses, then, developed the sharp thorns that would go on to become metaphors for life in general and for the sorrow that seems to follow happiness.</div><div>This story resonated with an Acanthus mage named Abigail Mitchum who had recently joined the Silver Ladder. During her Awakening to Arcadia, she had seen the possibility of the Wise to earn the title, to delve into mysteries of the past and look to the heart of history\u2019s greatest triumphs and mistakes. The potential to teach, to save and to succor was there, in the Awakened soul of every mage. The Silver Ladder, she was told when she emerged, breathless, from her Awakening, was the society of kings, the shining beacon of....</div><div>This sort of talk continued until she\u2019d pledged herself to the order. But then, slowly but surely, she learned that others didn\u2019t share her idealism. Abigail was a veteran of bureaucracy, both from civil service jobs and academia, and she recognized what she was seeing. The Wise, the Awakened, the all-powerful th\xe9archs, weren\u2019t looking beyond their own interests. They saw status within the orders as a goal in itself. Frustrated, she made friends with members of the other orders, and discovered that it was the same everywhere. Even in the Free Council, which didn\u2019t suffer from the same kind of pettiness, mages still saw clout within their own society as a goal.</div><div>Abigail thought that was absurd. Yes, people have a tendency to seek accolades, and they could still do good things while gaining status. But mage society was artificial, constructed around and in the cracks of Sleeper society as some desperate homage to a time that no living mage could verify, much less remember. Abigail held the Awakened to a higher standard than that, and dramatically left the Silver Ladder. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough for her to be a mage,\u201d one of her former colleagues muttered as she left. \u201cShe wants to be a superhero.\u201d</div><div>Abigail dropped out of sight and ventured across the world, meeting with order leaders, new cabals, solitary mages and those rare few who exist outside the Atlantean societal structure. She learned that there were other ways of doing magic. Power over the world could come from many sources, not all of them benign. A man\u2019s burning obsession could create life. A witch\u2019s potions could make someone fall in love. A wolf-skin, properly prepared, could allow a man to change into a beast. What Abigail took away from these meetings, aside from a great deal of arcane knowledge, was that either magic infused the Fallen World to a much greater degree than mages understood, or that they just weren\u2019t willing to admit it. And again, Abigail found that unacceptable.</div><div>She returned to her original Consilium five years to the day after she left. She approached the seat of the Hierarch and threw a thornless rose at his feet, and then turned to face the assembled Awakened. \u201cI am the Rose of Eden,\u201d she said, \u201cand I have shed my thorns. Anyone who wants to do so is welcome to find me.\u201d</div><div>A few of the mages in attendance did, in fact, come to see her, but only those on the Path of Thistle have so far joined the Legacy itself. Over the ensuing years, the Roses of Eden have spread out over the world, sometimes working closely with Consilium mages, sometimes shunning them and keeping company with other solitaries and non-Awakened sorcerers.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction </h2><div>Once a prospect has found a potential tutor, she must present her case. Why should she be allowed to join the Legacy? Wanting to keep membership in any of the four Atlantean orders (or \u201cpseudo-Atlantean\u201d orders, as some Roses call them) is grounds for immediate dismissal. Individual Noddists can choose to admit Free Council mages to their ranks, but not all are willing to do so. Only Acanthus mages are permitted to become Roses of Eden.</div><div>The prospect is subjected to lengthy questioning, and all answers are vetted against both mundane and magical investigation. The Roses like to know who they are dealing with. It isn\u2019t that they are afraid of infiltration (they tend to be transparent about their agendas and initiatives), just that they don\u2019t want people grubbing for power within the Legacy. The prospect also needs to present an accounting of what she has done with her life. Has she held down jobs or raised a family, or has she led a life of hedonism and sloth? The Legacy doesn\u2019t disapprove of pleasure, but the Roses can\u2019t abide idleness from mages. Recently Awakened mages, especially those who have careers and families and are still coping with the transition from Sleeping life to Awakened life, are never turned away, even if they can\u2019t actually join the Legacy (due to not being Acanthus or not being magically powerful enough). Such people are given support and mentoring, always with an eye toward building the ideal Awakened society \u2014 one in which mages help each other to explore the secrets of the world and protect those who cannot safely look upon those secrets, rather than squirreling them away and sniggering about it.</div><div>The Roses of Eden don\u2019t go in for showy initiation requirements. They see such trials as exactly the sort of thing that mages should be able to rise above. After all, a mage with even the barest knowledge of the Mind or Fate Arcana should know a lie when she hears one. An Apprentice of Time can get a sense as to whether a given prospect will or will not make a good member of the Legacy. Why not put these talents to use, and save the time that would otherwise be wasted in contests of strength, skill or political savvy \u2014 talents that can just as easily be bestowed by magic? The gifts of Awakened are nothing without the moral fiber to make good use of them, and if there is a spell to make someone into a reasonable and honest person, the Roses haven\u2019t discovered it yet.</div><div>Once a mage is accepted into the Legacy, she is expected to keep regular contact with her mentor for a period of not less than sixth months. During that time, she is also expected to act in some meaningful way, either to help other mages reinvent their society, help Sleepers combat the evils of their society, or find mages and other magic users outside the Atlantean power structure and enlist their help, or at least their knowledge. All of these can be dangerous jobs, and the Roses of Eden make no bones about it \u2014 they do not enjoy the same support that other mages do. \u201cBut,\u201d Abigail always says when this is pointed out to her, \u201cgive the Roses time to bloom.\u201d</div>",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"Abigail Mitchum was (and remains) a gardening enthusiast, not to mention a bit fixated on the metaphor of Eden-as-Atlantis.

In any event, after the third attempt by the Guardians of the Veil to silence her, Abigail developed a spell allowing her to sense minute changes in plant life around her. This enabled her to sense assassins coming before they could drive in the knife, and, surprisingly, even warned her of magical attacks.

The character thus always has an active Mage Sight, and can, with a reflexive Intelligence + Science or Animal Ken roll, know the age, sex and species of a living thing.

Abigail noted early in her campaign that if she looked well-rested and hale, her audiences, be they mage, Sleeper or stranger beings still, received her politely and with more respect. This Attainment allows a Noddist to appear perpetually healthy, with the bonus of allowing her to heal damage to her body more quickly into the bargain, by combining her knowledge of plant life with her ability to heal herself.</div><div>The mage can reflexively heal all bashing damage once per scene, no matter how much she has taken or whether or not she has any more severe wounds. In addition, she can spend one point of Mana to downgrade any lethal damage on her Health chart to bashing damage. Finally, if she suffers enough lethal damage to starting bleeding to death (see p. 173 of the World of Darkness Rulebook), she automatically spends a point of Mana and stabilizes herself. She is still unconscious, but is in no danger of dying unless she takes more damage.</div><div>To use any of these powers, however, the character must either be in direct sunlight or be able to touch bare earth.

The tree needs to be of a variety that bears fruit, and it must be grown without magical assistance (that is, the character must tend and water it normally). The mage must plant the tree herself, though a sapling works just as well as a seed. When the tree bears fruit, the fruits carry within them the power to heal. Anyone who eats the fruit of the tree is immediately healed of damage equal to the mage\u2019s Gnosis, in either bashing or lethal damage. If the mage has Life 4, the fruits can heal aggravated damage as well.</div><div>Although the mage cannot use Life magic to speed the growth of the tree, she can use any mundane method she wishes to speed up its growth. Abigail Mitchum was known to tend an apple tree using this Attainment, but she also grew tomato plants in her basement using hydroponics. The tomatoes worked just as well for healing as the apples.</div><div>The mage must infuse the tree or plant with one point of Mana per day to allow the plant to soak up the necessary magic. Water infused with Tass is acceptable, and some Roses have even been known to infuse plant food tablets with Mana to feed their magical trees. If a plant goes more than three days without a point of Mana, it loses the ability to function as a Tree of Life until infused with a full month\u2019s worth of Mana.</div>",thirdAttainmentName:"Tree of Knowledge",thirdAttainmentPrerequisites:"Gnosis 7, Life 4",thirdAttainmentDescription:"<div>\u201cAwakening is the act of eating of the Tree of Knowledge,\u201d Abigail Mitchum liked to say. \u201cWe listened to the Serpent, no matter what form he wore at the time, and we took a big bite. That\u2019s not the Fall. The Fall was assuming that eating that fruit meant we knew something that other folks didn\u2019t, and could never know.\u201d Abigail felt, especially after her travels, that the Fall of Atlantis was relevant only insofar as it provided a good model of what not to do. Arrogance, elitism and pride were the enemies, and sectarianism and divisiveness were what strengthened those things. The Tree of Knowledge, she came to feel, was not dangerous because it revealed, but dangerous because knowledge itself was dangerous. Knowledge could paralyze or divide just as easily as it could teach or heal. And Abigail, never one for inaction, decided she would show people the unity that knowledge could provide. This Attainment was the result.</div><div>Those mages who have experienced the Tree of Knowledge Attainment describe the feeling as extremely unsettling. The Attainment requires that all participants touch, skin to skin (holding hands is the usual method, though more intimate versions have been known to occur). The mage then uses the Attainment to make slight alterations in the Pattern of all of the participants, changing animal matter to plant matter on a cellular level. The result is an increased awareness of one another\u2019s state of being and an ability to understand one another, which lasts for the duration of the scene. The participants all feel a sudden dulling of sensation from sound and sight, but experience a kind of synesthesia \u2014 they feel light rather than seeing it. Also, perception of difference between people fades, not to visual perception, but to cognitive association. That is, participants notice details like race, size, age and so on, but do not attach much meaning to them.</div><div>In game terms, the player rolls Presence + Empathy + Life. Any character that wishes to resist can roll Resolve + Gnosis, contesting the mage\u2019s roll. If the mage succeeds, all participants gain an immediate sense of the physical health of everyone involved, similar to the Life spell \u201cHealer\u2019s Trance.\u201d In addition, the characters become passive and incapable of violence against one another for the duration of the scene, though they are capable of defending themselves against outside threats (any combat rolls made by participants during this scene suffer a \u20131 modifier, though). Finally, participants become linked on a deep and primal level for a short time. Reactions to surprise are made collectively \u2014 as long as one player succeeds, none of the others are surprised. Also, the participants can disperse injury among them, potentially ignoring it altogether. Two participants can absorb a point of bashing damage, five can absorb a point of lethal damage, and eight can absorb a point of aggravated damage.</div><div><i>Example: A Rose of Eden uses Tree of Knowledge to link a cabal of mages and their Sleepwalker servants \u2014 seven people in total (five mages, including the Noddist, and two Sleepwalkers). As they are growing accustomed to their new awareness, a trio of Seers of the Throne attacks the cabal. One Seer takes a baseball bat to one of the mages and inflicts three levels of bashing damage. Every two people linked by the Tree of Knowledge absorb one point of bashing damage, however, so none of the damage gets through (all seven of the participants wince a bit, but no injury occurs). Another Seer stabs a Sleepwalker for four points of lethal damage. Since it takes five participants to absorb a point of lethal damage, only one point is absorbed. The participants distribute the other three; three characters each suffer one point of lethal damage. Finally, the last Sleeper casts a destructive spell that inflicts two points of aggravated damage to the Noddist. Since only seven people are linked by the Tree, this damage cannot be absorbed, but it can be distributed so that the mage doesn\u2019t have to suffer both (or any) damage.</i></div>",thirdAttainmentOptArcana:"Prime 4",thirdAttainmentOptDescrizione:"<div>If the mage also possesses Prime 4, two additional effects occur when she links a group with the Tree of Knowledge. First, the participants all enjoy the benefits of \u201cSupernal Vision\u201d for the scene, even if they are Sleepers. Second, all participants become resistant to outside magic. Any spell that targets one member of the group suffers a modifier as though trying to target all of them. This modifier is applied whether or not the mage would actually be capable of affecting all of the participants.</div></div><div><i>Example: Continuing with the above example, one of the Seers tries using the Death spell \u201cEnervation\u201d on the Rose of Eden. The Seer only has Death 4, and so is not capable of casting the spell at sensory range (and thus cannot affect all seven targets at once).

The leader, a brash and hot-headed Obrimos named Steven Babbit (he changed his Shadow Name often, but always chose something offensive \u2014 past Shadow Names included Bitch, Faggot, Kike, and Queer), fell into a bout of depression following the death of his lover. Wandering the streets of San Francisco, he found a fetish bar he\u2019d never heard of. He entered, walked into a private room, and told the master on duty to kill him. He backed up that request with a magical command, using Life magic to bring out a killing instinct in the man.</div><div>Over the next six hours, Steven discovered a place that was past pain, past suffering, bleeding, and even pleasure. At the end of the ordeal, as he hung upside down, bleeding and scarred, flesh burned from elecrodes, he found enlightenment. He realized that the sensation the body could endure had limits, but that once those limits were surpassed \u2014 not just surpassed, but ignored \u2014 the mind could be free, even for a short while.</div><div>He left that morning as the sun rose, and took a new Shadow Name: Ecstatic.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Forming the New Legacy</h3><div>Ecstatic was an Adamantine Arrow, but had never been serious about the order before. He enjoyed their training in martial arts and magical combat, but was more interested in sexual exploits than in the order\u2019s service-oriented mentality. After his enlightenment, though, he was desperate to share what he\u2019d learned, and so contacted his old mentor, an Arrow Thyrsus named Breaker. The two of them discussed what Ecstatic had experienced, and Breaker felt that the younger mage was on the verge of reshaping his soul without help, becoming the founder of a new Legacy. Ecstatic, who had never been very clear on how this process worked anyway, spoke with other mages who belonged to Legacies and realized that the ordeal he had gone through had left him raw, naked and broken down. That was perfect for the kind of soul-change necessary for a Legacy, but it also meant he would have to do it again.</div><div>He went back to the site of the club, but all he found was a boarded-up building. Confused, he asked one of his cabal-mates to check the building\u2019s past, but all she found was echoes of music and moans of pleasure. Clearly, this place had been used for sex at some point, but not nearly as recently as Ecstatic had claimed. Ecstatic theorized that he had dreamed it all, that his experience had been a kind of second Awakening. He called on an acquaintance, a Mastigos named Minerva, and asked her to hurt him and not to stop for any reason. Minerva combined magic with her ministrations, and the experience very nearly killed Ecstatic. But hours later, he lay there bleeding once again... and rose, wounds healing, feeling stronger than ever. He had become the first of a new Legacy, and he wished to spread its philosophies.</div><div>Ecstatic\u2019s cabal fractured after this point. Most of them had no desire to undertake a task like joining a Legacy. They were content to party and use their talents for self-gratification. Some, though, stayed with their former leader, and joined the Adamantine Arrow and then the Legacy, which took the name of the cabal as its title. Word spread throughout the Consilii of California of the \u201cS&M Legacy,\u201d and it became a kind of joke for a while (\u201cS&M Legacy? Where from?\u201d \u201c\u2019Frisco, of course.\u201d). But every so often, a mage with an interest in pain, either for the purposes of enlightening or simple pleasure, came to find Ecstatic and his people. Slowly, the Legacy spreads out from the California coast.</div><h2  style='margin-bottom: 10px;'>Induction</h2><div>Joining the Legacy requires searching out a current member and stating the desire to join. The established Whipping Boys evaluate the supplicant, but the Legacy doesn\u2019t take on many pupils. The Legacy is very intimate (see Organization, below), and so new recruits are more often drawn from friends and lovers of a member, rather than strangers. That said, if the chemistry is right, the Whipping Boys might at least agree to a Session just to see what the supplicant is made of.</div><div>\u201cSession\u201d is the rather euphemistic title the Legacy uses for its hours-long ordeals of sensory overload. Although pain is a large part of it, Whipping Boys also use pleasurable stimulus (though never actual sex) to bring the supplicant into the desired state. Different members of the Legacy employ different methods \u2014 electricity, fire, cutting, whipping, pin-pricks and extremes of cold and heat are all possibilities. The mages aren\u2019t above using magic to achieve effects that no Sleeper master could hope for, and, likewise, the Whipping Boys generally keeps a healing spell ready (hung using Time magic, if possible \u2014 see p. 260 of Mage: The Awakening) in case things get too far out of hand. But apart from a real threat to the supplicant\u2019s life, the Session doesn\u2019t stop until the supplicant reaches enlightenment. \u201cThe safe word is Paradox,\u201d is a common phrase in the Legacy. It means that only something as powerful as the Abyss can stop the Session.</div><div>Once the Session ends, the supplicant is left alone to contemplate. Sometimes, the supplicant decides this Legacy isn\u2019t for him after all. Sometimes, though, the supplicant realizes that in that moment of formless perfection, past the pain and the clamps and the tools, there is a beautiful moment of peace and clarity. Those are the mages that the Legacy accepts.</div>",magic:"",attainmentsDescrizione:"<div>The Attainments of the Whipping Boys are designed to make best use of the moment of clarity that comes after the Session. As such, they build on the body\u2019s responses to pain as well as the immense wealth of knowledge and insight in the unfettered consciousness.</div><div>Not all members of the Legacy have the Dream Merit, but most of them develop it after joining. The Session leaves the mind in a perfect state to gain access to the universal body of knowledge. In game terms, when a Whipping Boy uses the Session to activate the Dream Merit, the player adds the character\u2019s Gnosis rating to the roll for the Merit.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Session</h3><div>Successfully undergoing the Session requires that the character move past pain and even bodily sensation, becoming completely open to his own mind. How, though, do you represent that in game terms?</div><div>It might not be necessary to do so. The character\u2019s mentor is, presumably, skilled enough to bring the character through the Session inflicting little actual injury on him. Likewise, a lover or master with whom the character is very familiar probably knows him well enough to push the right buttons, so to speak, without really hurting him.</div><div>If, however, you need to know if the character reaches the state of enlightenment at the end of the Session (perhaps time is a factor), you can use the following system. The Session is an extended action. It is also a teamwork action (see p. 134 of the World of Darkness Rulebook) in which the Whipping Boy is the primary actor. The character administering the pain is the secondary actor. Unlike most teamwork actions, in this case the two characters have different dice pools. The secondary actor\u2019s player rolls Dexterity + Wits, while the Whipping Boy\u2019s player rolls Wits + Composure. Each roll requires 30 minutes of \u201cwork,\u201d and the target number of successes is (the character\u2019s Stamina + Resolve + 10). If the character also has the Iron Stamina Merit, those dots are also added to the total number of successes required. A mage with sufficient dots in the Life Arcanum can use the Degrading the Form spell (p. 186 of Mage: The Awakening) to make it easier on himself.</div><div>The character suffers one point of bashing damage for every 30 minutes of the Session, and does not heal while it is still going on.

This action can include combat (hand-to-hand or ranged, though Ecstatic prefers close combat), but could also be used to flee from the fight if things aren\u2019t going well.

Pattern scouring (p. 78 of Mage: The Awakening) is another possible method.</div><div>Activating the Merit requires the expenditure of one point of Mana, and a reflexive Stamina + Resolve + Life roll. If the roll succeeds, the player chooses one Physical Skill. For the rest of the scene, any rolls involving that Skill gain the benefit of the rote action rule (p. 134 of the World of Darkness Rulebook). The first roll the player makes using that Skill is a rote action at no cost. Every roll after that requires the expenditure of one point of Mana. If the character wishes to enjoy the benefit for more than one Skill, he must activate the Attainment again.</div><div>Example: Ecstatic is in a fight again \u2014 seems he shot off his mouth at the wrong bar.

The goals of these mages are two-fold. They seek to examine the details of the future and then to prune it like a bonsai. Their goal is to allow only those events to occur that further their particular aims. In addition to shaping the future to meet their needs, the Architects also attempt to quest deep into the Astral Realm, exploring the edges of the Anima Mundi for clues as to the wishes, desires and ultimately the nature of the Exarchs. They then incorporate any insights they gain about the Exarchs into their plan for the future.</div><div>This Legacy is slightly more than 500 years old. It was founded in Florence in the late 15th century, when travelers brought back many previously lost or unknown texts from the Middle and Far East. A few of these seemingly mundane texts were actually long-lost grimoires that the founders of this Legacy used as the inspiration and basis for its attainments. When it first began, the Architects were exclusively focused on learning to shape the future in a precise and exacting fashion so as to advance their founders\u2019 agenda. The Legacy was crafted so as to provide members with both the knowledge and understanding needed to examine the future and discern the actions needed to obtain their desires. The Attainments also provided members with the tools needed to help them accomplish these actions. However, within a few decades some of the senior members of the Legacy began to question the wisdom of shaping the future in such a precise fashion with no regard to the plans of the Exarchs. Several argued that acting purely in the interests of the members might cause their agenda to contradict the wishes of the Exarchs, which could lead to utter disaster if the Exarchs decided to punish them. Also, a few of the more philosophically inclined members believed that the Exarchs have a divine plan for the Fallen World, and that it was the duty of the Architects to attempt to discover these plans.</div><div>Several of the founding Architects believed that the best way to contact the Exarchs was to explore the further reaches of the Astral Realm. To enable them to more effectively accomplish this, they forged a path to the Omphalos of the Anima Mundi that was only open to other Architects. From here, they could explore out to the furthest edges of the Anima Mundi, looking for clues and hints as to the Exarchs\u2019 plans and desires. Definitive answers are effectively impossible when exploring the Astral Realms, and Architects frequently argue about the nature and meaning of any discoveries one of their number makes when exploring the furthest depths of the Anima Mundi. However, they still treat these experiences are worthy of consideration and all Architects take an oath to record all of their journeys into the Astral Realm.</div><div>To attempt to make sense of the Exarchs and to keep track of their various manipulations of the future, the Architects of the Future created several large libraries containing records of every major prophecy and every astral journey their members have made for the last 500 years. These records are as much as source of power for the Architect as their attainments. This information also provides unique insight into both the nature of the Anima Mundi and many details of success and failure when attempting to manipulate the future.</div><div>The Architects are an unusual Legacy in that only the most powerful members gain the knowledge and insight needed to divine the pattern of the future, create the plans needed to change it or to attempt to learn the Exarchs\u2019 desires. Less powerful and experienced members learn how to vastly increase their effectiveness in performing various tasks, but gain no special insights into how best to apply their efforts. Members begin as agents or foot soldiers and work their way to becoming leaders and planners.</div>",alternateNickname:"Architects, Spiders",orders:"",appearance:"Most Spiders dress in clothing that is comfortable, utilitarian and that does not inhibit movement. Their clothing also always contains many discrete pockets where they can conceal weapons and other useful items so that they do not attract attention. Because junior members can be sent out to perform some mission at any time, most choose to carry concealed weapons and other useful tools like lock-picks with them at all times. Regardless of their status in this organization, Architects also tend to dress in a relatively high-class fashion. They do this both out of a sense of pride common to members of the Legacy and the recognition that maintaining the appearance of having high social status is an excellent way to minimize Sleeper interference. Most Spiders regularly wear designer suits and athletic gear and other similarly expensive garments. They also possess clothing appropriate for a wide range of settings and activities. Because lower-ranking members often perform dangerous tasks, their jackets, coats and similar garments are often lined with Kevlar or similar materials to provide additional protection against attack.<div>Architects move with confidence and determination. Most appear to be important and charismatic individuals regardless of how they are dressed. They also display a keen awareness of tactical advantage. Intelligence operatives, soldiers trained in commando work, experienced police officers and others who share these traits often notice that the Spider acts like they have had training in combat or covert operations. To Sleepers who lack such training, Architects seem highly competent and possibly somewhat dangerous.</div>",background:"Architects tend to come from physically active backgrounds. Some were soldiers or security personal, others were serious martial arts enthusiasts or athletes and a few were professional criminals.

During their Awakening, Spiders suddenly become aware of the larger realities of the Fallen World and most develop a keen interest in pursuing mystical truths.<div>Spiders are highly ambitious and most are comfortable in structured and hierarchical environments. However, for some their ambition was something that grew out of their Awakening, as they suddenly understood how much more power they had than ordinary mortals. Many joined the Legacy as part of their search for answers to the various questions their Awakening raised. New members must be content to accept the answers provided by their superiors, but most are also eager to advance in this Legacy until they too can make plans rather than simply execute them. Spiders possess a mixture of comfort with physical activity, ambition and a relentless desire to both understand and shape the future.</div>",organizzation:"This Legacy is one of the most tightly organized and hierarchical legacies available to the Seers of the Throne. Every member has specified duties that they are regularly called to perform. Members are free to go about their own affairs most of the time, but when one of the senior members sees some situation that requires alteration, they can call upon other nearby members for assistance. All lower-ranking members are required to assist them to the best of their capabilities; while such missions are always presented to members as \u201crequests\u201d, refusing results in a loss of both status and good will, and also a loss of access to the recorded prophecies and other records held by the leaders of this Legacy.<div>Advancing upwards in the Legacy grants members increased power and authority within it.

No amount of money will make them the person they want to be \u2014 beautiful, influential and desired. They feel that even as members of the secret rulers of the world, their rightful place is denied to them. Maybe they\u2019re the wrong height, wrong color, or wrong gender. Maybe they just have no social graces. Eventually, they may hear of a Legacy, first founded in the Hegemonic Ministry, which promises to turn members into members of the Elite. By sacrificing everything that makes them themselves, they can create new identities, like a caterpillar becoming a butterfly, and live the lives of luxury and adoration they have watched with envious eyes since their Sleeping days.</div><div>There is a difference between physical alterations that serve a medical need and chasing an unhealthy ideal, and the members of the Chrysalides Legacy are firmly in the chasing category. Every Chrysalis has a dual identity \u2014 the nature of the Legacy is such that they can transform from their real self, which they call the \u201cHusk\u201d, into an idealized self created from the imagination and self-loathing of the Seer. Each Chrysalis only has one \u201cIdeal\u201d, one alternate persona, chosen on joining the Legacy. After the initial act of creation, the Ideal can be improved further \u2014 granted beauty, cleverness, wit, physical superiority... Anything the Seer believes his real form lacks. But it comes at a price. Every improvement is taken from the real form, which degrades as the Ideal perfects, and there are no take-backs and no second chances. Eventually, a Swan becomes both Beauty and the Beast, the Ideal a living Goddess and the Husk a withered crone. The Legacy sees it as a worthwhile sacrifice, hurrying through the time they spend as the Husk before they are able to transform again. Other Seers shake their heads at the pettiness of the Legacy, muttering that the Awakened should have higher goals. The Swans, surrounded by fawning admirers, don\u2019t agree.</div>",alternateNickname:"Swans, Mirror-Gazers (Derogatory)",orders:"",appearance:"As Husks, Swans hide themselves away \u2014 those that must leave isolated chambers and private suites do so wearing concealing clothes, hiding their faces from themselves as much as from the world.

A sufficiently powerful relic of Atlantis or a particularly revealing recording of a gathering in a hostel can both be exceptionally damaging to the Seers\u2019 cause. In addition, one of the best and most effective ways to manipulate events is by altering or destroying various objects. If an inventor is about to demonstrate his creation before an audience and the device has either been sabotaged or destroyed and replaced with a version that works either much less well, or perhaps much better, the results of that demonstration will be very different than they otherwise might.

Other Seers usually consider Destroyers to either be calculating mercenaries or half-mad fanatics and make certain to distinguish one sort from the other.

She opened a terrible, necessary door to envelop the Fallen World in a spiritual desert: a cloak of madness that bars the Supernal Realms to all but a few powerful, eccentric wills.</div><div>That\u2019s the taboo. Like all taboos, people break it from time to time. Seers disobey, search and usually don\u2019t find anything. Sometimes, they\u2019re caught and punished. A few become Scelesti, and claim to serve the Gate. That\u2019s a lie \u2014 they\u2019re only slaves of the Abyss.</div><div>A few succeed. They find the Lonely Exarch. They join a Legacy that\u2019s had many names over the centuries. The Secret Order of the Gate is its latest incarnation, founded over 100 years ago by a pylon that lost three Soldiers to the Pentacle (especially Nameless mages who joined the Free Council) and two more to treachery \u2014 rivals who hit them when they were down. That sowed the seeds of doubt, fueled the quest for power beyond the accepted Iron Seals. In 1901, the last three found the Gate in Chicago. Some say they used an Artifact called the Celestial Flange to call her from the Place Between.</div><div>So began the Secret Order and its mission. It is the demiMinistry of the Gate, the Warder, The Fearful Reconciler, King of Zero. They love him. They worship her utterly. That slowly, invariably drives them mad.</div><div>The Secret Order\u2019s inner doctrine speaks of the Serpent and the Tree. The Tree is the Fallen World, growing from filth up to the Supernal Sky. The Celestial Ladder was inevitable; the Tree always climbs, using the smaller life within in to manifest that fecund desire. If it ever grew too tall, it would envelop the heavens in its unclean tendrils and choke existence to death.</div><div>It must be pruned, dismembered and hurt from time to time. The Exarchs did it when they cut down the Celestial Ladder, and the Gate does it still, with the blackest, sharpest blade of all: the Abyss. That\u2019s the anti-reality\u2019s purpose. It\u2019s the Serpent, Niddhog gnawing at the World Tree \u2014 but it too must be restrained. The Serpent and the Tree live in symbiosis. Unbeing seeks being, and devours it. Being fills the void until it\u2019s either stopped, or suffocates.</div><div>That\u2019s why the Secret Order of the Gate calls Abyssal horrors into the world, and why it banishes them when they stay too long or eats too deeply into the Tree\u2019s heartwood.</div><div>They let the Serpent prune the world in small pulses of destruction, designed for symbolic import. Killing a city is excessive; killing the man who represents the city is good enough, and the manner of his ending is the rite that controls that symbolic power. So the world is left a smaller place \u2014 Fallen, but alive \u2014 without raising poisoned branches to the heavens.</div><div>The Secret Order believes in two paths of service: the Opening Way and the Warding Way. Openers summon Abyssal manifestations; Warders banish them. The perfect Gatekeeper performs both duties, but few can maintain the balance. They see too much.

The Secret Order believes the Lonely Exarch used it to command the Abyss to open, and tame the newly-Fallen World \u2014 and to banish it, so that the fallen World would survive. It is a language that gives comprehensible structures to the Abyss\u2019 anti-entities. It\u2019s a tongue of negatives, that defines things based on what they are not, providing a general conceptual shape \u2014 even a prison \u2014 for Abyssal entities.</div><div>All Gatekeepers know the Parametric Language. They can conduct conversations in it, though its grammar makes this a slow, clumsy process. Its chief use is in dealing with the Abyss. Chanting it adds +1 die to spells the specifically target Abyssal entities or manifestations.

It\u2019s hard to find the Secret Order, so to even start the journey, a prospective member has to explore locked archives and ask dangerous questions.

Instead, they believe that the Abyss needs to be employed more aggressively. Many Openers think humanity should suffer through a great Abyssal tribulation that ends in a smaller world with a less arrogant population. To the Secret Order, hubris is the Tree\u2019s desire for growth, expressing itself through its human components. Curing it with a lasting, terrible darkness would protect the Supernal Realms. Warders channel their fear of the Abyss into a passion for opposing it, though that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll block the Secret Order\u2019s plans, either.

The fact that celestial beings could traverse the Abyss and enter the Fallen World has long been a sign of hope to many.

A member of the Adamantine Arrow, the clergyman fought alongside his order to stem the tide of the growing power. All but the most concentrated strikes did nothing, and many Arrows were lost. As much a scholar as a warrior, Grimaldi turned to books and prayer to find a way to overcome the menace. As his fellow Arrows fought and lost skirmish after skirmish with the creatures of the Void, the Theurgist locked himself in his study, refusing food or water or rest until he could devise a means of victory.</div><div>Forty days and nights past before Grimaldi exited his chambers.

Grimaldi led the Pentacle mages to victory, his celestial companion powerful enough to combat the brunt of the Void\u2019s assembled might.</div><div>After the battle, Father Alessandro told the assembled that the answer was not found in his books, but in his prayers.

The Aetherial being that accompanied him on the field of battle had come to him in his hour of need, offering assistance and support. Over the course of the last week of the monk\u2019s seclusion, Grimaldi and the Supernal being spoke. The angelic form taught him much of the power of the Aether and how to combat the Abyss directly. It helped the Jesuit to shape his soul to enable it, and other instruments of the Oracles like it, to descend to the Fallen World and heed the call to battle.</div><div>In the years the followed, Grimaldi accepted many students; reports of the conflict in Naples spread far and wide, and numerous individuals wished to command the power of Supernal forces.

While some continued to cling to the old ways, keeping them sacred and alive, most were gradually battered down by colonizing frontiersmen and those who followed in their wake.

What he discovered was more and far different than he had hoped, transforming both his mission and his soul. When Ahota returned, he soon gathered five apprentices to himself, only two of whom were of Hopi descent, to pass on what he had learned of the katsinam, the life-bringers; spirit guides who educate the young in the important truths of life. Out of respect for his people\u2019s tradition of obfuscating the deepest nuances of their language from the uninitiated, he simply called his Legacy the Katsinam Suukya, after the title of the life-bringers (already well known outside of the tribe) and the Hopi word for \u201cone,\u201d leaving it to the listener to decide whether Ahota intended them to be \u201cone with the katsinam,\u201d \u201cone of the katsinam,\u201d \u201cone chosen by the katsinam,\u201d or something else, entirely.</div><div>Ahota eventually passed on (though some say he simply vanished into the Shadow once more), leaving a council of elders \u2014 several of whom were not Native Americans, let alone Hopi \u2014 to govern the Legacy after his death.

She called herself Lady Peacock, and she was trying desperately to change the status quo of London\u2019s Awakened community. Rigid traditionalists amongst the Silver Ladder and the Mysterium dominated the Consilium.

Even Lady Peacock\u2019s fellow Libertines were simply trying to hold onto what little they had, rather than reaching for something better.</div><div>Rather than growing discouraged, however, Lady Peacock determined to evolve through a revolution of thought. She studied the patterns of her native London, following strands of the unfolding future, looking specifically for those near to the Awakening. It was by no means an exact science, but destiny must have had a special place set aside for the young Enchanter, who used her powerful Fate magic to ably perform feats only barely within the limits of the mundane, within plain sight of only those few who were struggling to cast off the Lie. While hidebound elements within the Consilium disapproved of Lady Peacock\u2019s antics, it was actually a th\xe9arch \u2014 also an Acanthus \u2014 who came to her defense, arguing eloquently to all that nothing she did in any way truly threatened the Veil or otherwise compromised the security of local willworkers as a whole.

This, as she saw it, was for the best, as each would challenge the others to truly question the rightness of what they did. For the first time, she began to run into the students of her own students, eclectic spirits utterly unknown to her, and Lady Peacock was overjoyed by the ecstatic chaos of it all.

The names of heroes, past and present, are venerated in song, story and even with worship in some societies. The Stygian Heralds go beyond simple adoration to remind others of the capacity heroes have to inspire. They call up the souls of dead heroes, borrowing their strength to serve the living.</div><div>The Stygian Heralds were founded by a Moros who was studying several unusual Artifacts recovered from mystically sealed vault beneath Uchisar, Turkey. The vault itself was an obvious product of magic, the weapons and armor found within had unusual properties that didn\u2019t seem to be the result of enchantment. After months of study, the Moros came to the conclusion that the Artifacts were somehow still bound to their dead owners. The Artifacts seemed to draw energy from a different realm; in them he found the mystical signature of the leaden oppressiveness of Stygia and the echoing eternity of the Underworld. Alongside his continuing studies, the Moros began to experiment with methods of imbuing mundane objects with the same energy and, through trial and error, eventually created the first Attainment of a new Legacy.</div><div>Feeling that he was close to a real breakthrough, the willworkers enlisted the help of several other Moros to assist him in the continuation of his work. He taught them the methods behind his first discovery and the cabal began to call itself the Stygian Heralds: Stygian in honor of their path and Heralds in homage to those humble souls who walked before heroes of lore announcing their coming. Many years passed and when the original founder of the Legacy died, in accordance with his wishes, his name was struck from every record of the Legacy, ensuring that he would be forgotten and allowing him to abide in peace. Stories persist, though, inside the Legacy and without, about whom the founder really was.</div><div>A few mages, prompted by jealousy (or so the Heralds believe), declared that the founder must have been a Tremere. They suggest that only someone with in-depth knowledge of how to trap and manipulate a soul could have developed magical means of compelling the shades of the dead, of ripping them from wherever it is they rest. The Stygian Heralds refuted the idea, pointing to the fact that the founder died of natural causes: an unlikely event for a Tremere. Another group of mages posit that the first of the Heralds was a descendant of the Orphean tradition, citing the mythological character as one of the few mages to ever descend to the Underworld and return intact. The Heralds openly scoff at this theory, rightly pointing out that no one is sure exactly from whence the practices of the Legacy call the dead souls. It\u2019s just as likely the shades are drawn from the Supernal, or even the Astral Realms, as from the Underworld.</div><div>Questions of founder aside, the Stygian Heralds slowly spread their wisdom throughout Awakened society and not everyone approved of their methods. It was a member of the Adamantine Arrow who dubbed them \u201cResurrectionists,\u201d likening their practices to those of grave robbers. Rather than being insulted by the nickname, the Heralds embraced it, noting that the actions of the resurrectionists helped further the science of medicine with their grim deeds. The side-effects resultant from the Stygian Herald\u2019s blessings didn\u2019t go unnoticed either. Individuals that repeatedly served as host to the souls of heroes had a tendency to go insane. Still, in times of great need, no one could deny the effectiveness of the Stygian Heralds\u2019 rituals and so they were allowed to continue their practices. Possibly because of the dubious nature of their studies, the Heralds have never grown to the same prominence as other Legacies.

In fact, with the clever use of even the most elementary of magic, it may well be within the cabal\u2019s power to piece the puzzle together in given sequence. Willworkers are often particularly suited to unraveling even the most obscure mysteries in relatively short order, once they actually realize they\u2019re on the trail of some shred of esoteric lore.

As their numbers slowly grow and individual members become more and more a part of a single, segmented consciousness, they attract more attention. Perhaps other mages have to take steps to silence the Legacy and the characters, as outsiders, are drawn into the struggle.

One of them, Ellis Weaver, was wounded in battle and returned home before the end of the war. Another, George West, was promoted and rode out the war in command bunkers, rather than in the field.

They could work within that system, they felt, or they could live forever outside of it.</div><div>That night saw the beginnings of the Quiescent, a Legacy devoted not to the destruction of magic or its removal from the world, but to the practice of magic that would work within the Fallen World. Their magic would be invisible, explainable as coincidence, guiding rather than forcing. Yes, it would be challenging, and yes, they would be leaving behind some of their most impressive abilities. But they would also be safer. As paranoia grew in the wake of the brewing Cold War, the three of them were even more convinced that they were right.</div><div>Over the next few years, the three of them trained other mages in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Detroit in their philosophy. They inducted a few into the Legacy, once they were sure that the subject was ready to leave behind the quick power and flashy results that vulgar magic brought. Their philosophy and magical style, known as Quiet magic, proved more popular (and, obviously, easier to adopt than the Legacy), and other mages began spreading it. Entire Quiet cabals, known as \u201cWhispering\u201d or \u201cSotto Voce\u201d cabals, arose, but the Consilii to which they belong rarely had a sense of who they were or what they were doing. As such, they gained a reputation as being untrustworthy, maybe even Seer plants.

In his letter to his friends, he claimed that it wasn\u2019t working. It wasn\u2019t enough to work magic invisibly. Magic needed to stop. With horror, George and Ellis realized that Hans had become a Banisher. Within three weeks, more than 20 Quiet mages across the country were dead. Hans couldn\u2019t possibly have killed them all, or so his former cabal-mates thought \u2014 not unless he was using his mastery of Space magic to transport himself around.</div><div>Ellis and George contacted as many of their followers as they could, but part of the Quiet philosophy was a focus on avoiding easy detection. As such, by the time they could make contact with many potential targets, they were already dead. Wracked with guilt, the two of them stepped back from Awakened society in 1950.</div><div>Many practitioners of the Quiet philosophy, though, never having actually met the three founders, were perfectly safe (at least from Hans). They went about their lives in the bleak years of the late 1940s, attempting to live in harmony with the direction that the Sleepers seemed to be taking the world.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>The Quiet Philosophy</h3><div>As mentioned in the text above, the most important principle of the Quiet philosophy is that the mage use no vulgar magic. Every spell the mage casts must be in keeping with the natural laws of the Fallen World. That means that the mage should have some grounding in physics and probably other scientific fields as well, and Quiet mentors often counsel their pupils not to rely on the propensity of Sleepers to shrug off weird occurrence. Yes, Sleeper witnesses might say, \u201cit could happen,\u201d but magic does not occur in a vacuum. The Abyss is always watching.</div><div>Beyond that, however, the Quiet philosophy doesn\u2019t ask much. Mages aren\u2019t expected to follow precepts of non-violence, beneficence or honesty. The founders did endorse living in the Fallen World and not pretending it was something other than it was. Mages have the same choices and opportunities as Sleepers, and sometimes that means taking the dirty money or pulling the trigger.</div><div>As might be expected, some mages take the wrong lessons from Quiet. It\u2019s easy to hear \u201cdo what you have to do\u201d and see that as \u201cdo anything you want.\u201d This is one reason that Quiet mages have bad reputations in many Consilii. Fortunately, another important precept of Quiet is keeping one\u2019s head down and staying out of sight of the authorities, both Sleeper and Awakened.</div><h3  style='margin-bottom: 0;'>Quiet Magic in the Modern Age</h3><div>What happened to the Quiet mages and the Quiescence Legacy? Hans never came for George or Ellis, but the two of them vanished from Awakened society entirely. Their first pupils formed a cabal which remained active into the 1950s (and is detailed in the Appendix to this book), but their whereabouts after that point are unknown. It is probable that, as the paranoia of the 1940s and 1950s gave way to the radicalism of the 1960s, the philosophy simply became outmoded and unpopular.

People have vanished, without a trace. Wide areas of the Consilium\u2019s territory have been despoiled by some supernatural force, crumbling every living thing to dust in crop-circle like patterns. No witnesses saw anything, but a few report hearing something \u2013 a terrible howl in the distance, like a hound.</div><div>The Gwynedd Consilium in Northern Wales is sparsely populated but has a historical reputation for producing innovative mages. The isle of Anglesey is the origin of many druidic Legacies, and the Consilium still claims to have been founded by the Acanthus Archmage now remembered as Merlin. In 2005, a th\xe9arch Obrimos named Argent arrived in the Consilium, claiming to have retired from work as a Lictor abroad. His Cabal had been killed by Seers, he claimed, while chasing rumors of an Ascended mage in the hopes of following her footsteps.</div><div>In fact, Argent had fled his Cabal after coming to the conclusion that Ascension was not possible and being rather too open with his opinion. He proposed that if the Supernal Realm was barred, the Silver Ladder should seek to move humanity to another world away from Fallen reality, somewhere mages could assume the godhood the order promised. Denounced as a heretic, he stole grimoires describing pacts with beings from outside Fallen reality and fled before his theft could be uncovered. His Consilium declared him Left-Handed in his absence, but he had no intention of ever going back.</div><div>Argent didn\u2019t come to Gwynedd by chance. The region is rife with verges and sealed gateways to other realms, perhaps the aftereffect of the long-vanished archmaster\u2019s studies. He needed a Hallow in a remote area where the walls of the physical world grew thin in order to complete the ritual he\u2019d uncovered. The blasphemous texts spoke of an in-between place, a void which was not the Abyss but could be filled by the energies of the Fallen World if an explorer was talented enough at giving form to Mana.</div><div>Argent conducted his ritual with the blood of a sacrifice boiled in the center of his Hallow, tainting the Mana there. When he absorbed the Mana into his pattern, he felt something inside his soul open, and found himself elsewhere, floating in nothingness but surrounded by Mana.</div><div>Discovering that he could create Phantasms using the energies around him, Argent shaped a crude world for himself before the effect wore off and he returned to his body in the Fallen World. He was greeted by devastation \u2014 the integrity of solid objects around the Hallow had been siphoned by the forces unleashed, the Mana he\u2019d been fashioning stolen from everything around him.</div><div>And something had come back from his new world \u2014 which he now knew to be in the Lower Depths. Something tied to his pattern. Something that hungered.</div><div>Seven years later, Argent \u2014 now calling himself Arawn \u2014 has recruited a Legacy of followers. By tainting the resonance of Mana they absorb, membersoftheLegacycanproject themselves into the pocket-world, which is now a sprawling paradise garden filled with earthly delights, beautiful art and even human life. In Annwn \u2014 named for the paradise of Welsh myth \u2013 they are free from Paradox and the threats of the Fallen World. They have achieved the promise of the Silver Ladder, but it does not come without cost.</div><div>Annwn is built out of Phantasms and ephemera, although the Legacy hopes to recruit enough Masters to create true patterns one day. It is inherently unstable and requires vast amounts of Mana to avoid breaking up and being absorbed by the rest of the Lower Depths. The void it was built in is also far from being uninhabited. Every member of the Legacy is host to a being of the Lower Depths, an invisible force that lacks any of the Arcana and so is extremely difficult to perceive with magic. These \u201chounds\u201d are invisible and intangible, having no Life, Matter, or Forces Patterns to be interacted with, and serve as roving feeding appendages for Annwn itself. The hounds siphon integrity from the Fallen world and feast on raw Mana when they can, funneling the energies into the Lower Depths where they support the Legacy\u2019s dreamworld.</div><div>The Cwn Annwn have found that, with effort, they can force their hound to rebuild a facsimile of what they destroy within Annwn, which gives them some measure of control over what is sacrificed to power their realm. Their paradise is built from these stolen patterns \u2014 when a Gardener finds something worthy of inclusion in Annwn, he directs his hound to reduce it to Mana and the image of it appears within the realm. Arawn cautioned his followers to only use this when it would not be noticed, but some members of the Legacy have taken the practice to extremes \u2014 and worse, begun using the ability on living beings. The \u201chuman\u201d inhabitants of paradise are the reconstructed images of Sleepers and mages the Cwn Annwn thought worthy of inclusion, broken puppets with the faces of people the hound felt met his criteria.</div><div>Arawn wants the Legacy to develop Arcana until they don\u2019t need to steal any more \u2014 he hopes that once he is able to create Hallows for Annwn to feed from, the realm will become self-sufficient. He wants to entice a Master of Life and Mind into the Legacy, as they will then be able to create real (albeit soulless) people inside. For now, though, he is increasingly alone in his quest as the Legacy succumbs to impatience. Led by a student named Hafgan, the Cwn Annwn have begun travelling across Consilii, taking whatever they want and recruiting more mages to the Legacy. With exposure to magical society, the risk increases that someone will work out what the Cwn Annwn are doing and hold them to account for it. Until then, they\u2019ll continue moving from city to city, telling tales of their unearthly paradise beyond the Exarch\u2019s sight.</div>",alternateNickname:"Hellhounds, Gardeners",orders:"",appearance:"When proselytizing, Gardeners maintain the respectable image of a Silver Ladder mage, well-dressed and exuding a friendly air of authority.
