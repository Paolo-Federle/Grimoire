The person in question must have glanced into the mirror within the last 24 hours, even if the look was only fleeting, and the changeling must know that person’s first name. The changeling asks the mirror a question regarding one of the Attributes or Skills (this question is framed not as, “How many dots does Red Wren have in her Strength Attribute?” but more as, “Tell me mirror, how strong of body is Red Wren?”). The mirror speaks into the changeling’s mind, telling the character of the target’s aptitudes in the given Attribute or Skill (the changeling learns that, say, “Red Wren is no stronger than most mortal men,” which the changeling’s player can probably interpret to mean “Red Wren has two dots in Strength”). Some say the Keepers used to use such mirrors to learn about their imprisoned charges while they blindly wandered the halls of the Others’ dark manors.",

The mad Keepers, rarely with any kind of solidarity, managed to assemble a military force that intended to break through to this world and subjugate it — making it just another part of the beautiful nightmare that is Arcadia. The Beylik did not exist at the time, but some say it was this mad conflict that birthed them: a select few banded together and helped a military leader ascend to the topmost position of the local freehold. Under this leader, the Beylik helped form an army of Lost, and the True Fae were routed. The war was terrible, and the Fae’s own weapons were turned against them. This includes their terrible spears, each unique to the Keeper who used it. Even now, the tips of these spears lay hidden within the Thorns — some are lodged in trees, others tangled in barbed loops. For some, the earth hides them: kick aside the dirt to find the tarnished bronze beneath.",

The only exception to this is if the changeling chooses to make a Perception roll the recipient of the token’s Wyrd bonus (at which point no penalty is given, and the full bonus is received). The reason for the Perception penalty is that, when considering fate, the changeling looks for fate’s fickle fingerprints — often in the wrong place. She becomes easily distracted.

            "Every diviner within the College of Worms is expected to possess a divining tool suited only to her. She chooses the nature of the tool: a pouch of runes, a cup of pigeon bones, a hand-drawn Tarot deck, a scrying mirror made from an old Maybelline compact. Upon joining the order, the pledge to become a diviner connects this instrument to the strands of fate, if only with a few perfunctory threads, enough to grant the token a small and relatively safe measure of power (anything greater would wreak havoc upon the poor changeling who carried it). The token’s power is passive. The changeling uses the device (tossing the bones, reading the cards or whatever mechanical action one normally performs to “use” the diving tool), and upon activation receives no insights at the time of use. The insight comes later. When about to make a roll, the player determines that the insight is finally revealed to the character and helps grant her feelings (be they instincts or an odd déjà vu sensation), which translate to bonuses on that roll. The character can take a number of dice equal to the character’s Wyrd score and add them to that roll. However, this must be done within a number of hours equal to the changeling’s Clarity score. If she goes beyond that time limit, she cannot access the hidden insight provided by her divining tools, for they are lost. The Diviner’s Instrument is a fickle thing, much as fate itself, and can only be used once per game session."

There are many kinds: Indian charka of ancient design, the walking wheel for wool and others born of many times and cultures, all used to turn fibers into thread or yarn. According to custom, every Goldspinner carves his initials or personal sign on his wheel. Some old Gildwheels are covered in markings, but most only have a few, as they’ve more recently drifted from the Hedge in accord with the old, secret pacts that founded the Guild.",
            "Other than these markings, Gildwheels look like normal spinning wheels — tools or antiques, depending on who you are. A Goldspinner (or anyone else) claims a Gildwheel by touching it and investing a Willpower dot. Once he does so, he always knows where it is. He can take back the Willpower at any time, so the player can’t spend Experience to replace the lost dot. Without this investment, the Gildwheel will not function and the Goldspinner can’t locate it. If someone destroys the Gildwheel the Willpower dot is lost forever, but it can then be replaced with Experience.",
            "When a properly bonded changeling puts fiber to the wheel he can spin gold. It comes out in unnatural looking strands that the Guild calls “Sif’s Hair.” Sif’s Hair is real gold, but its silky, light, flexible qualities make it useless for mortal commerce because it doesn’t look like normal gold at all. Fortunately, any decent smith can melt and beat it into bars, coins and jewelry. Once the Goldspinner starts to work the wheel it puts out Sif’s Hair at an exponential rate, producing one Resource dot’s worth per day, to a maximum number of dots equal to the changeling’s Wyrd. Other users are limited by equivalent supernatural traits such as Gnosis, Blood Potency or Primal Urge. Mortals can spin one Resource dot’s worth of gold. Of course, these other users need to mind the Token’s catch (see below).",

The Skill comes or goes completely; if she only has Crafts •• to give, that’s all she can give. If the subject has Athletics •••••, then the ruler must take all of those dots, no more, no less. (In addition, if the Skill taken or given is equal to a Skill already possessed at that level or above, no change occurs.) That said, the king does not preternaturally know how many dots a subject possesses in a given Skill — certainly he can guess that the Olympiad runner has noteworthy Athletics, while the wisp of a poet may not possess a great Brawl score in comparison to what is probably a prodigious Expression Skill. Also worth nothing, the Skill traded means that Skill is lost for the day. If the queen offers her Craft, then she no longer has it to roll. If the queen thieves a subject’s Subterfuge, then the target will surely have trouble conjuring a lie for the remainder of the day (and this can be the reason the queen steals it in the first place, not because she wants the Skill, but because she hopes to rob the subject of its benefit)."

One enacts the token’s power and then must pay some manner of price (usually to the changeling or Keeper who offered the token to begin with).",
    "Promise tokens are normal items sworn upon by both present parties. Both parties must be made aware of the stipulations of a promise token — though, a changeling may certainly veil her language in imperfect terms, thus cementing the sometimes untrustworthy reputation that many Lost possess. When swearing upon a token, the changeling must spend a point of Glamour, and the other party (whether changeling, mortal, vampire, whatever) must offer either a Glamour or a Willpower point.",
    "At that point, the promise token binds both characters and may be enacted by the target at any point. Enacting a promise token’s power requires no roll and no expenditure of Glamour or Willpower unless otherwise noted.",
    "The key, though, is that a promise token’s “catch” is always active. It occurs in every instance (it’s really what makes a promise token a two-way street: when one is given a vial of blood that a changeling swears could save a human from death, the human is wise to ask, “What’s the catch?”).",
    "Characters are encouraged to come up with their own promise tokens. The parameters to keep in mind is that the target gains something, as in a pledge, but then must pay some debt (usually instantaneously) upon accepting the gift (i.e., activating the token). Some targets never activate a promise token: a Black Nickel may sit at the bottom of a mortal’s coin cup forever without triggering the debt.",
    "Promise tokens needn’t be purchased with Merit dots. Promise tokens simply exist to the benefifit and detriment of both parties; because each promise token is gift and payment in one, the “cost” is built into the object and thus demands no experience points spent. A promise token does count toward a changeling’s limitation on pledges, however."
