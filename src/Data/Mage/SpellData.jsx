        "DescrizioneMiddle": "<p>When someone directs a vulgar spell at the mage or other targets whom the mage wishes to protect, he can cast a countering spell that creates a form of magical interference, weakening or even canceling the attacking spell, similar to how an obstacle can act as cover against a ranged attack. He must first have Mage Sight to be able to perceive the attacking spell. Like a dodge action, he can cast Counterspell against vulgar spells cast by another mage with a higher Initiative. (He cannot counter attacks with lower Initiatives if he has already performed an action in the turn. See “Dodge,” p. 156 of the <b>World of Darkness Rulebook</b>, for rules on how this circumvents the normal Initiative order for the turn.) A mage can even counter sympathetic spells cast directly at him (but not those cast at other targets), by sensing the sympathetic conduit being forged by the spell (again, he must have Mage Sight for this). </p><p>Successes are subtracted from the target spell’s Potency. If the target spell is left with no Potency, it is canceled entirely. If even a single point of Potency remains, the spell is applied against its target (at its reduced Potency). </p><p>A covert spell cannot normally be countered, since the defending mage must first identify its Arcanum components using the normal rules for doing so (see “Scrutinizing Spells,” p. 278). Such investigation is not normally possible within the same turn in which the spell is cast, although some Time magic might give a mage the extra time needed or clue him in on what spell the caster will cast before he casts it. Vulgar spells do not need this kind of scrutiny; they are obvious enough to counter within the same turn of casting. </p><p>A spell aimed at more than one target does not need to be countered for each target; a successful countering diminishes or prevents its effects against all targets. </p><p>A countering mage must have at least one dot in one of the Arcana used by the attacking spell. For example, to counter a conjunctional Mind 3 + Life 2 spell, a mage needs either Mind 1 or Life 1, but not both. If he does not have a proper Arcanum lore, he cannot counter the spell. Counterspell can be learned as a rote (use Occult Skill), but it must be learned separately for each Arcanum to which it applies.</p><p>A mage with two dots of Prime can instead use the “Counterspell Prime” spell, p. 222, to counter any spell, regardless of Arcanum. In addition, Counterspell Prime allows him to counter covert spells (assuming he has active Mage Sight) without first needing to identify them.</p>"

On his turn in the Initiative roster, Zeno casts Shifting Sands, rewinding himself through time by one turn. In the original turn, he entered the alley. This time, during his replay, he decides to turn the other way and run, never even showing his face around the corner. From that point on, all other characters redo their actions as if the original turn never happened. Since Zeno doesn’t enter the alley, the thug doesn’t fire his gun (as he did in the original flow of time). He still awaits Zeno’s appearance as his cue. </i></p>This spell cannot undo any effects the mage suffered the first time he experienced the turn that he replays. If he got shot in that turn, and then casts this spell to replay that action, he still suffers from the gunshot wound, even though he might decide to dodge in his replay of the turn, causing the bullet to miss him. (And if it does hit him, he suffers a second wound!). This spell does not erase the effects of time on the mage. It merely allows him to step back in the river of time by one turn and replay its flow. Although he cannot reverse any harm he himself has suffered, it can be instrumental in allowing the mage to save the lives of others. <p>Those other than the caster may feel a sense of déjà vu about the situation, but for them the caster’s new action is the first and only time this turn has happened or will happen. Participants remember the turn only as it has just been played, not as it was previously played before Shifting Sands altered it. (Unless one of them uses the “Temporal Wrinkles” spell, p. 258, in which case he is aware of what happened.) </p>With Time 4, the mage can cast this spell upon others, allowing them to alter their actions when replaying the turn.

The process and form of the ritual is different for each realm, and is discussed in detail under the appropriate realm sections. <p>Before beginning the ritual, the player must decide upon how many successes the mage will attempt to accrue. The formula is as follows: </p>The mage needs 10 successes to open the gateway. Every additional success has one of the following effects: <ul><li>Extend the duration in which the being can remain in the Fallen World without suffering damage. Each success adds 30 minutes. If the mage allocates no successes to this duration, the being begins taking damage immediately.</li><li>Protect the gateway from Abyssal intrusion. Every success thus allocated allows the player to make one additional roll without the Storyteller checking for the Abyss creeping into the gateway. </li></ul>In addition, the following factors add to the necessary total: </ul><li>Add one success per Sleeper present. In addition, a Sleeper’s presence renders the spell improbable. </li><li>Add one success per mage of a different Path present. </li><li>Add one success if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to a realm other than the one in question. </li><li>Add one success if the mage has caused a Paradox (even if he contained it) within the last week.</li><li>Add one success if the mage is AbyssMarked (see p. 71). </li><li>Subtract one success from the target if the summoning is taking place in a Demesne oriented to the realm in question. </li><li>Subtract successes if the character incorporates items and conditions into the summoning that correspond to the realm in question. The sections on the different realms later in this chapter list sample correspondences, but the character must still weave these correspondences into the spell gracefully enough to ease the casting. The Storyteller can either adjudicate the number of successes shaved off the total based on the player’s descriptions of his character’s actions, or the player can roll Intelligence + Occult. Every two successes on this roll removes one success from the target number of the summoning spell. </li></ul> <p>Once the player has determined the target number of successes and how they will be allocated, he can start rolling. The amount of time required for each roll is, of course, determined by the mage’s Gnosis rating (see p. 76 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). The player is not limited in the number of rolls he can make, but fatigue will eventually begin to set in. A greater danger, though, is Abyssal intrusion. </p>The player can make a number of rolls equal to the character’s Resolve + Composure + any successes allocated to avoid Abyssal intrusion. After that point, the Storyteller rolls the character’s unmodified Gnosis for every roll that the character makes. If the Storyteller accrues a number of successes equal to the mage’s Gnosis + [ruling Arcanum used to cast the spell], the Abyss breaks into the gateway, and the creature that arrives is not a Supernal being but an Abyssal one. The Storyteller should by no means reveal how many successes she gets on the intrusion rolls. The Abyssal being that arrives might impersonate a Supernal one, at least for a while. More information on Abyssal summoning and the creatures resulting from them can be found in Chapter Three. <p><b>Example:</b> Whim, an Acanthus of the Mysterium, decides to call down a recondite being from Arcadia as part of her ongoing quest to unravel the nature of the Fallen World. She is a Master of Fate, so she is more than qualified to cast the spell. Her Gnosis is 3, so every roll requires one hour. She requires 14 successes to start — 10 (base) + 3 (three of her cabal mates are present) + 1 (she caused a Paradox within the last week). Her player decides to add in three more successes. Two are allocated two duration (if she is successful, the being will be able to survive in the Fallen World for an hour without taking damage) and one is allocated to stave off Abyssal intrusion. Her Resolve + Composure is 5, so with the success she has allocated, her player can make six rolls before Abyssal intrusion becomes a problem. </p><p>If she fails to accumulate 17 successes in six rolls (which is a distinct possibility), the Storyteller rolls Whim’s Gnosis rating for every roll beginning with the seventh. If the Storyteller accumulates eight successes (Whim’s Gnosis + Fate) before her player finishes accumulating the 17 needed for the spell, an Abyssal entity intrudes. </p><p><b>Concluding the spell:</b> Once the Supernal being has returned “home,” the mage needs to channel the magic he used to work the summoning into something else. Leaving the spell “open” is dangerous, because if he does so, sooner or later the Abyss will seep in. The spell can be closed easily enough — the mage simply needs to choose what spell to cast. The player makes the appropriate roll, the spell occurs, and the gateway closes. </p><p>If the spell rolls fails, though, or if the Supernal being dies from exposure to the Fallen World or is deliberately destroyed outside the summoning circle, the gateway collapses. This creates a temporary portal to the Abyss. Every mage within 50’ of this portal suffers a number of Health points of aggravated damage equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. In addition, the portal remains open for a number of days equal to the summoner’s Gnosis. During that time, the mage needs to watch the portal carefully, because Abyssal creatures can and do escape into the Fallen World. </p>"

If a character has Time 5, use the Advanced Prolongation chart (so blocking an Indefinite span of time, such as occluding an entire human life or the history of a building, would require Time 5 and a –10 dice penalty). Large or multiple targets can impose further penalties.</p><p>If a mage wants to block a section of time that itself is far in the past, use the modifiers for sympathetic ties (see <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>, pp. 114–115), but for the temporal connection. The less accurately you can define the span of time you want to occlude, the weaker the sympathetic tie will be. For instance, erasing “Bob’s history between 8 and 10 p.m. last Tuesday, when he was at that motel” would provide a Known connection: you know exactly what time, by clock, calendar and what the subject was doing. Having an object tied to a specific event in that timespan, such as the wrapper of a cheeseburger Bob ate in the motel room, would raise the connection to Intimate. However, hiding “Bob’s visit to the motel some time last week” would provide, at most, an Acquainted connection. If you had no idea when Bob might have visited the motel, the connection would be Unknown, and the spell would fail; and, of course, you would need Bob’s presence to block that episode in his past, anyway. </p><p>A mage can also perform “Erase History” through an Extended casting, and try to accumulate enough successes to erase a span of history from temporal sensing. </p>",

He must first have Mage Sight to be able to perceive the attacking spell. Like a dodge action, he can cast Counterspell against vulgar spells cast by another mage with a higher Initiative. (He cannot counter attacks with lower Initiatives if he has already performed an action in the turn. See “Dodge,” p. 156 of the <b>World of Darkness Rulebook</b>, for rules on how this circumvents the normal Initiative order for the turn.) A mage can even counter sympathetic spells cast directly at him (but not those cast at other targets), by sensing the sympathetic conduit being forged by the spell (again, he must have Mage Sight for this). </p><p>Successes are subtracted from the target spell’s Potency. If the target spell is left with no Potency, it is canceled entirely. If even a single point of Potency remains, the spell is applied against its target (at its reduced Potency). </p><p>A covert spell cannot normally be countered, since the defending mage must first identify its Arcanum components using the normal rules for doing so (see “Scrutinizing Spells,” p. 278). Such investigation is not normally possible within the same turn in which the spell is cast, although some Time magic might give a mage the extra time needed or clue him in on what spell the caster will cast before he casts it. Vulgar spells do not need this kind of scrutiny; they are obvious enough to counter within the same turn of casting. </p><p>A spell aimed at more than one target does not need to be countered for each target; a successful countering diminishes or prevents its effects against all targets. </p><p>A countering mage must have at least one dot in one of the Arcana used by the attacking spell. For example, to counter a conjunctional Mind 3 + Life 2 spell, a mage needs either Mind 1 or Life 1, but not both. If he does not have a proper Arcanum lore, he cannot counter the spell. Counterspell can be learned as a rote (use Occult Skill), but it must be learned separately for each Arcanum to which it applies.</p><p>A mage with two dots of Prime can instead use the “Counterspell Prime” spell, p. 222, to counter any spell, regardless of Arcanum. In addition, Counterspell Prime allows him to counter covert spells (assuming he has active Mage Sight) without first needing to identify them.</p>"

The presence of bystanders has no effect on the magic, though the speech must be targeted specifically at an individual rather than being a general address. If the spell succeeds, the subject never forgets that information without the interference of other magic or powers. Mind 2 is required for the mage to target himself; scribing other minds requires Mind 3. With an additional dot of Mind beyond these requirements, knowledge may be imparted telepathically rather than aloud. Resolve is not subtracted from the caster’s pool if the target is aware and willing. Although not widely known outside of the forbidden ranks of the Unforgotten Scions, this spell can also be cast more aggressively on a Sleeper target, in which case the spell costs one Mana point. If the spell succeeds, the target not only remembers the branded information forever but also develops a perverse fascination to share the knowledge with others per the Fixation derangement (see the <b>World of Darkness Rulebook</b>, p. 97); this derangement potentially flares up whenever the subject of the information comes up in conversation or the target is actively reminded of it, promoting the usual Resolve + Composure roll to resist. Any new fixation implanted this way replaces all existing ones, so a victim only needs to worry about the most recent obsession. Furthermore, he may permanently overcome such madness by spending one dot of Willpower or raising his Morality; otherwise, such madness is permanent. Damaging a Sleeper’s mind this way is an act of hubris, requiring a mage with a Wisdom higher than four dots to make a degeneration roll. More importantly, doing this is an excellent way to attract the attention of the Unforgotten and its enemies.",

Instead, the Guardians must be content to discredit both the source of the information and the information itself. If the Guardians cannot use this rote on the actual source of information, either because it was a live broadcast or because it is a rumor spread by word of mouth, or printed in a book or newspaper, they implant information in all manner of related electronic media that influences the public’s view of the original source. While it is often impossible to stop a rumor, Guardians who are skilled with this rote can often alter the nature of a story so that their revised version swiftly replaces the story they wish to suppress. Guardians have numerous uses for this spell that do not directly involve causing the public to disbelieve a specific piece of evidence for the existence of magic. However, using this (or any other) spell to cause Sleepers to believe in magic more is one of the most serious crimes one of the Guardians of the Veil can commit, unless this is done inside of the strictures of an occult Labyrinth, where the Sleeper’s belief in a conspiracy theory or occult phenomena might be the key to redirecting that Sleeper into falsehoods.

Used in this fashion, the spell only reveals thoughts shared by a significant proportion of the people within the area. In addition, this spell only provides a very brief and general impression of such shared thoughts — the caster might discover that most everyone within a single city block is thinking about the recent power outage, the widespread job cutbacks in the area, the noisy roadwork on a nearby street, and rumors about a woman who appeared out of midair three days ago. Alternatively, the caster can use Mind 4 to determine if a particular name, image, sound, face, or some other short phrase or simple sensory impression evokes a strong response from the people in the designated area. When used in this fashion, the spell both reveals the approximate proportion of the people who feel a particular way about the image or phrase and roughly how they feel about it. With the addition of Time magic, this spell can also be used to determine how residents of this region responded in the past. The complexity of receiving and analyzing so much information is the reason that this spell can only be performed as an extended action. When performing it, the caster typically sits down in front of a map or photograph of the area he is going to examine. He then sinks into a deep trance that continues until he either successfully casts the spell or gives up the attempt.",

Lucia never found a lich, however, as none existed within the Consilium to find. Instead, she discovered that the rumor had been seeded by two Seers of the Throne who had quietly replaced Councilors, and that they were using the paranoia that the story engendered to gradually weaken any hope of concerted resistance when the time came for their allies to strike.

The goal of the gathering matters little (Burning Man offers a generic focus on creativity, self-reliance, and ecstasy while something like the Harmonic Convergence was a conscious attempt to turn humanity’s collective soul toward positive karma and dharma), but the gathering of people is a focus. Also important is that a number of the gatherers must be operating with some manner of psychoactive in their bloodstream (the number of dosed individuals isn’t a hard or fast number, but one can assume that approximately 1/4 of the attendees should have recently imbibed some kind of entheogen). Another focus of the festival is a key symbol that serves as the literal center of the activities. At Burning Man, it is obviously the giant effigy (which may actually burn or may be a figure comprising neon tubes and car parts), while at other ceremonial festivals it may be a central tree representing Axis Mundi or a sacred figure (such as Om, some kind of Buddhist mandala, or a figure from Native American or Japanese symbology) laid across or etched into the ground. Music is the final focus. It may come from a drum circle, or may instead be trance music pulsing from a tower of speakers.

When the fetter is destroyed, the demon is unraveled just as if it had failed to fetter itself during the initial duration of the spell.

As with most Kabbalist spells, it begins with chanting in the High Speech for a half an hour. Once the ritual proper is begun, the mage takes up a silver dagger (representing both Chokhmah and his desire to do harm), with which he traces the names of Michael and Kamael in the air above the altar. Finally, at the completion of the casting, he pierces an image of the desired target (or another object which has sympathy to the target) with the dagger, then transfers the object to a burning brazier to be consumed. If the ritual is performed during the astrological hour of Mars (for example, at dawn on a Tuesday), the Mana cost is waived.</p><p>There is no common consensus as to the appropriate number of successes the willworker should target with this spell. Most agree that it should last no less than two days, so five successes are often allocated to Duration; alternately, the spell's conditional duration is often set so that the spell expires if the target deviates from a course of action the caster finds displeasing — for example, a Pulsa di Nura cast on a businessman might be set to end if the target gives up his efforts to buy the apartment building that houses the mage's sanctum.

(Note that few mages can long bear to live with homunculi smarter, cooler or more charismatic than themselves.) The homunculus’ Mental Skills also cost one success per dot, with a limit of five dots per Skill. Social Skills obey the same limit but cost three successes per dot. Next the alchemist determines the degree of loyalty the homunculus feels toward its owner at the beginning of its career. (Although disloyal homunculi rarely become more favorably disposed toward their owners over time, initially steadfast individuals come to gradually rebel when subjected to continual mistreatment.)[TABLE1]<p>Loyal homunculi reserve their obedience for a single master, unless an affinity for others, most often fellow cabal members, is built into their personalities.</p>[TABLE2] Homunculi exhibit exaggerated, simplistic personalities. They generally model themselves either on the human donors of their organic tissue, if any, or on the alchemists who construct the homunculi’s personalities. They conduct themselves as one-dimensional parodies of their models, which can be disconcerting, especially to the persons they’re aping. By allocating five successes to the homunculus’ personality, the alchemist can specify another role model. The creature will still seem off-putting, but in a different, presumably more acceptable way. The proto must be left to spend significant time with the role model during personality formation. Spirits and ghosts, as well as living persons, can act as role models. The model may be physically present or represented by extensive audio or video recordings. It is therefore possible to imprint a homunculus with the persona of a public figure, celebrity or even a fictional character. When animated, this primal personality may be complicated by one or more derangements or Flaws (see below). The alchemist can prepare for this by choosing one derangement or Flaw for every five successes allocated for this purpose. If the homunculus does acquire derangements or Flaws, it gains those pre-selected by the alchemist, as opposed to merely random ones chosen by the Storyteller during animation.",

The consciousness dissolves when the spell expires.

(Use the Duration factors given for prolonged spells on p. 120 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b> to determine how far back the caster can reach in his attempt to consume the subject’s sin.) There exist certain interesting complications to this process, however. <p>First, the subject must be willing and desirous of sincere repentance. Of course, part and parcel with a failed degeneration check is a feeling of vindication in one’s improper actions, so this true longing for redemption is often easier said than done, and usually works better with either those who are, by nature, intensely virtuous or, conversely, those who have perceived an overarching pattern of wrongful behavior in themselves and wish to turn back from the path of hubris. Whatever the case, it is only a genuine commitment to self-betterment that empowers this spell’s soul- mending effects.</p><p>Second, the spell isn’t a guarantee; merely a chance. The subject receives the opportunity to re-roll the degeneration check, automatically subject to a +1 die bonus for sincere remorse. If this check succeeds, though, the subject regains the lost Wisdom without cost and loses any derangement gained <i>through that particular instance of degeneration</i>. (derangements from other sources — including other instances of Wisdom degeneration — remain.)</p> <p>Third, the Guardian can cast this spell only once on a given subject between instances of degeneration. (In other words, no “going back” to the next instance of degeneration and trying to undo that one as well, thus enabling another willworker to potentially skyrocket in Wisdom.)</p> <p>Fourth, the Guardian must pay the piper, as it were, by accepting the burden of sin upon his own soul (and regardless of whether or not the subject actually succeeds in his “second chance” to feel regret for his prior actions). In the case of any act at least 2 dots <i>above</i> the Guardian’s present Wisdom score on the hierarchy of sins (see <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>, p. 79), this entails no degeneration check: his soul is simply too scarred already to suffer appreciably on account of this new burden. In the case of sins within one step of the Guardian’s present Wisdom score, in either direction, this involves a degeneration check for the Guardian, as normal, subject to all the customary consequences for either success or failure. In the event of a sin at least 2 dots <i>below</i> the Guardian’s present Wisdom score, this entails an <i>automatic</i> loss of Wisdom and the customary subsequent check to resist gaining a derangement.</p>",

First and foremost, the <i>Codex</i> grants a +1 modifier to all degeneration checks made by its current owner, as well as a +1 modifier to the roll to avoid gaining a derangement in the event of an unsuccessful degeneration check. Whether this is on account of metaphysical proximity to Plures’ ideology of eternal sacrifice or some other reason is unknown; some Guardians have spent years researching the seemingly enhanced moral and psychological resiliency of an owner of the <i>Codex</i>, but to no avail. Further, regular study of the <i>Codex</i> grants a Guardian of the Veil (or any that manage to decipher its many tiers of hidden meaning) a +2 modifier to any rolls to influence, infiltrate, or otherwise interact with the structures, policies, and procedures of nearly any Sleeper occult society wholly or partially of Western European origin, with traditions (whether legitimately handed down, pilfered, or acquired by whatever other means) spanning back to at least the early 18th century. This insight is the result of regular perusal and contemplation of the symbolism integrated into the text, and so functions only for one who has reviewed the grimoire within the past month.

The “Loyal Possession” spell takes effect through a series of subtle turns of fate and slight of mind. <p>Example: Zeno’s cell phone is stolen from him, but it has Loyal Possession cast upon it. So the thief accidentally runs into someone on the street and drops the phone into a trashcan without noticing. Later, a homeless woman fishes the cell phone out of the trash and carries it for several blocks. She leaves it in an alley behind a local pizza parlor. A kid working there comes out back to empty the trash and picks up the phone on his way back in. He idly wipes it down with a damp rag and sticks it in his pocket. A call comes in for delivery of a large sausage and mushroom pizza, and the kid wraps the phone up in a sheet of foil and sticks it into the pizza box without even thinking about it. The delivery guy takes the pizza to the customer’s address, and when Zeno gets his dinner, he unwraps the foil to find his missing phone. “There you are,” he says. “It’s about bloody time, too.”</p><p>The exact sequence of events is left to the Storyteller’s imagination (with input from the caster’s player, as desired). Sleepers can act as unwitting agents of a Loyal Possession without being consciously aware they are doing so, and seemingly “random” events can conspire to help get things done. Exactly how long it takes the object to get back to its owner depends greatly on circumstances: a small item could cross an urban area in mere hours, while a larger item could take days. There are also a few limits on the effect. First, the spell doesn’t work if the item’s owner willingly gives it away (even under duress). So if you hand a Loyal Possession to someone, it’s effectively “theirs,” and the spell isn’t triggered, but is actually transferred to the new “owner.” This can be used to grant others Loyal Possessions, however.</p><p>Second, if the item ends up in the possession of an Awakened character, he can hold on to it so long as he keeps the item on his person. So if an Awakened enemy takes a Loyal Possession from you, for example, and keeps it in his pocket, it stays with him. However, as soon as the item is out of the Awakened character’s possession, it may try to find its way “home.” So, if your foe happens to put the Loyal Possession down on a desk or side table, for example, the Loyal Possession might get picked up by a Sleeper servant or bystander, knocked out a window or into the garbage and so forth, slipping the net to start its journey back.</p> <p>Finally, a Loyal Possession brought inside a ward (see <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>, p. 236) loses its “fix” on its owner and cannot continue to return until the item is brought outside the ward, and the item can’t influence events to help bring it outside. It becomes “stuck” in the warded area. Short of undoing the spell, this is the surest way to hold on to a Loyal Possession that doesn’t belong to you. This spell is commonly imbued in certain valuable items, and a number of artifacts display similar capabilities (although artifacts are often more capricious about “ownership,” sometimes just conspiring to seek a new and suitable “owner” when circumstances require it).</p>",

        "DescrizioneAlta": "Objects do not have volition of their own, but they are given momentum by the wills of the sentient creatures that act upon them. They are imbued with purpose by human belief in their designated purposes. Human choices become the destinies of such items. Thus, a mage with a stronger will than a Sleeper could, for example, decide that a rare heirloom will come into her possession. Through the quirks of fate, it eventually finds it way into her keeping. It may not do so in any way she might envision (and her ownership of it need not necessarily be legitimate or even legal), but she does not have to exert any special effort to acquire it. Indeed, she need not even know where the object is when she casts the spell. The item reaches her when it does, if it does (this spell could be dispelled before the item arrives; see below), and she has no control over the circumstances of how or when it arrives. Destiny makes no guarantees, for example, that a ritual knife a mage hopes to get won’t end up protruding from a wound in her abdomen by the hand of some crazed wino.<p>A mage can send a given object any which way she desires, specifying that a woman’s gold necklace ends up owned by the son she gave away at birth, or that a treasure chest eventually spends its days at the bottom of the sea. Using this spell with naked and indiscriminate greed often results in dire consequences for the caster (such as the aforementioned knife in the gut). Wise workers of Fate magic advocate using this spell for personal gain only when need is great, otherwise doing legwork personally and without the aid of magic. Some items have so much belief and will behind them, conscious or otherwise, that it is essentially impossible to move them from their current circumstances. While the Hope Diamond might be able to be moved (at a –3 penalty for its celebrity; see “Cult of Celebrity,” p. 115), the Leaning Tower of Pisa isn’t going anywhere, despite the fact that the technology certainly exists to disassemble, transport and reassemble it. The threads of fortune can only be stretched so far.</p>",

Excess successes added to the target number can speed up the journey by one degree per success.</p>[TABLE1]<p>This spell can target items within the Shadow Realm, although without a Spirit 3 component the item cannot cross the Gauntlet. It arrives just on the other side of the Gauntlet, probably brought by means of a hapless spirit.</p><p>Using this kind of magic for selfish or greedy ends, especially when a mage does so repeatedly, almost always leads to bad twists of fortune, often involving one or more of the objects the mage tries to acquire.</p>As with any spell targeting an unseen subject, the mage needs a Space Arcanum sympathetic connection to reach out and grasp the object’s strands of fate to draw them to him.

A complex object can be made to take on the overall appearance of any simple substance, but separate spells must be used to give the appearance of separate substances. Thus, with a single use of this spell, a pistol with a metal barrel and wooden handle might be given the appearance of being crafted entirely of gold. However, to give the pistol the appearance of having a gold barrel and ivory handle, two successful separate spells must be cast. Deceptive Appearance does not change the shape of the object. A glass beer stein may be given the appearance of being made of stone or steel, but it cannot be made to look like a martini glass. <p>Successes are allocated to casting factor (Size). At this level, the mage must touch the substance to change its appearance. At Matter 4, Deceptive Appearance can be cast at sensory range and can use advanced prolongation Duration factors.</p><p>Note: The change granted by Deceptive Appearance is visual only. The spell will not change the actual density, weight, taste, smell, or temperature of the substance. Wine that is made to appear to be water will still taste like wine and have its intoxicating effects, while lead that is spelled to look like wood will still sink if placed in water. The addition of Mind 2 to this spell allows a mage to grant a change the perception of taste, smell, weight, or temperature.

Pieces of furniture can roll on their wheels or walk and run on their legs, knives and guns can hop around and even throw themselves at targets, and drawers can slide out with sufficient force to injure someone. When an object attacks, use the spirit’s Power as its Strength. Animated objects can bend and flex in various unnatural ways. Most of their more extreme types of movement, such as a chair running across a room, are subject to Disbelief.</p><p>One limit on this spell is that unless the mage also uses Spirit magic like the “Control Spirit” spell, the object is free to act as it chooses. Objects owned by the mage will typically obey her commands, as will objects not asked to do anything self-destructive or against their inherent nature. (Guns normally attack people, drawers and chairs do not.) Objects that have been treated well by someone will not normally attack this person. Guns owned by a gun collector who takes excellent care of them will not attack the collector simply because the mage asks them to.

First, the mage prepares and ritually cleanses an altar, which is draped with a brown cloth (representing Malkhut) and on which the Golem's form is laid out. The mage need not sculpt the Golem himself, if he so chooses. Once the Golem is in place, two black candles (for Binah) are lit at the head and foot of the Golem, and the mage begins to carve sacred runes into the body of the inert statue (both to represent Hod and to provide the additional duration from Atlantean runes). The mage then chants in the accented High Speech favored by Kabbalists for thirty minutes before beginning the invocation proper, which involves readings from scripture and invocations to the archangels of the sephiroth. The traditional target number aimed for by Kabbalists is nine: five applied to the spell's Potency and four to its Duration (allowing the Golem to exist for two days, or indefinitely if the caster is a Master, counting the Atlantean rune bonus), but the caster is free to set his own desired target number. Often, the rote concludes with the mage writing the Hebrew word Emet (“Life”) on the Golem's forehead and setting the conditional duration to specify that the Golem will be destroyed if the first letter is erased, rendering the word Meit (“Death”)."

Highly armored homunculi are sometimes referred to as golems.</p>[TABLE3]<p>Alchemists with a taste for the exotic may equip their homunculi with natural weapons, from claws to horns to blades emerging from the forearms. As alchemists contemplate the baroque possibilities, they should remember that Guardians of the Veil hit squads have been known to target notably bizarre homunculi, and their creators.</p><p>Successes required for inherent weaponry are keyed to the damage dealt.</p>[TABLE4]<p>Rare alchemical texts may include instructions for even more exotic bodily features, from wings to secret compartments. The success cost for such embellishments is left as an exercise for the indulgent Storyteller.</p><p>Creatures of inhuman appearance are subject to the same damage from Disbelief as fanciful beings created with the “Hereditary Change” spell (see <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>, p. 192). They take Disbelief successes as bashing damage, once per scene, per witnessing Sleeper.</p><p>Failures on the casting roll to create a homunculus do not destroy a proto, but do deform it. With each failure, a small but noticeable visible imperfection appears on the proto’s body. Examples include scars, blemishes, drooping eyelids, gnarls of flesh and malformed or missing teeth.</p><p>With each dramatic failure, the spell must be started over. If the same gross material is used on a later attempt, weird physical features manifest, even if the next spell is cast without failures. A notably horrific physical feature appears: a withered arm, shark-like teeth, a useless third eye, a second face on the back of the head, tentacle-like growths or whatever other unpleasantries strike the Storyteller’s fancy.</p><p>Some mages deliberately handicap themselves for at least one casting, to ensure that their creation will be in some way imperfect. They thereby render the creation process less of an act of hubris — see the sidebar, below.</p>",

(Note: Transmuted versions of such materials are not acceptable.) The result, when properly crafted, a flawlessly mirrored substance. When charged with Mana, thaumium has a faint luminescence. A thaumium object may take the form of a necklace, breastplate, a watch or a sword. The shape and size of an object is irrelevant to how much inherent countermagic it provides.",

(If a mage wishes it, she could create thaumium with no benefits beyond countermagic.)</p><p>The alloy disintegrates when the Duration expires, so mages often cast this spell with an indefinite Duration. Use the following Duration factors:</p>[TABLE1]<p><i>Example: Crucible creates a thaumium ring. It has Size 1, Durability 4, a Mana capacity of five points, and an indefinite Duration. It requires 14 successes to make. One success provides Size 1, Durability 1 and a Mana-capacity of one point, while three successes boost the Durability to 4. Four successes boost the Mana-capacity to five, and six successes are needed to make its Duration indefinite.</i></p><p>Once made, the thaumium must be charged with Mana points. Each time it shields against magic (a reflexive action unless the wearer does not want it to), it uses up one of these points. If it runs out of points, it cannot shield magic until it is recharged. This shielding takes the form of a reflexive counterspell, effective against any Arcana and both vulgar and covert magic. The protection’s dice pool is equal to the thaumium maker’s Gnosis + Matter.</p><p>The wielder of a thaumium weapon can use the item’s stored Mana to make the weapon’s damage aggravated.

        "DescrizioneMiddle": "The foci for this spell are all three of the hallmark Templar symbols: the Baphomet, the Holy Cross, and a cipher. First, the Templar creates the sign of the Holy Cross on the ground where he wishes to commune with the angel — the cross in the circle serves as a sort of beacon to the angel in question. Next, the Templar speaks the name of the angel after it has been encoded as a cipher. The more important the “messenger,” the more elaborate the cipher must be. Finally, the Templar makes the hand-sign of the Baphomet when the angel arrives, proving to the angel that he is worthy of witnessing the light of God.<p>The Templar casting this spell makes a single call to a single, specific “messenger” angel (whose name he may have procured from any number of sources, liturgical or lay, but it must be the angel’s true name). The angel who heeds the call (if the spell is successful) is from the loftier regions of the Shadow Realm but has a singular connection to the Aether, or “Heaven” as the Templar understands it. Obviously, the “angel” is not from the Aether proper, but is savvy to what has occurred there in an up-to-date sense. In the communion with the angel, the Templar may ask the angel any questions that he wishes, and the angel responds with whatever information is salient.</p><p>Of course, mere men surely cannot grasp the full import of what occurs in the Realms Supernal, and the angel’s answers may seem obtuse, incomprehensible, or chaotic. As well, the angel might simply deem the answer to a given question as one the Templar’s mind cannot possibly understand, and may deliberately occlude or withhold information (though it will never lie outright). “What does God look like?” is not a viable question for this spell to answer, nor is “What is the meaning of life?” In response to this first question, the angel might loose a torrent of incomprehensible Enochian syllables, answering the question honestly, but in the language only the angels can understand. The second question might yield an almost rhetorical response, such as, “To live in righteous imitation of Christ.” The angels will not be fooled by vain men’s attempts to divine the secrets of heaven.</p><p>Information that may be legitimately gleaned is information that the angel believes men have the context to understand. For example, “Is God angry that we seek the Ten Commandments” is a question that would receive a concise answer, while “How does God feel about our quest for the Ten Commandments” would elicit either an answer incomprehensible to the Templar or a simple rebuff that “It is beyond your capacity to know.”</p><p>The answers asked of the angels need not always concern the loftier realms. “Is the Temple Mount the true site of the Temple of Solomon?” is a fine question to ask (the answer to which depends upon the individual chronicle). So is “Where have the Templars stored their treasures?” Indeed, so is, “Where are my car keys?” but such a flippant question may well serve to stoke the ire of the angel, and the anger of angels isn’t something any mortal is likely to emerge from unchanged. To this end, it’s worth noting that summoning the angel in no way offers any protection from it, should its divine graces be mocked, challenged, or denigrated.</p>",

They note that Abraham, Isaac, Moses, and other key Biblical figures had to use nothing of the sort to commune with God, while later figures such as Simon Magus had to use the same sorts of formulae that the order itself must. Of course, Simon Magus met his end after challenging God’s supremacy, but the Templars are certainly capable of learning from the mistakes of others.<p>Some Templars have taken it upon themselves to learn the celestial speech of the angels, potentially in hopes of tricking the angels to answer their questions with a language they assume the mortals not to comprehend. Again, the angels aren’t so simple as this. If an angel suspects a man might have learned the divine tongue, it might simply respond that the answer to a particularly dire question isn’t for men to know. And again, attempts at fooling the angels rarely work out well for the would-be trickster.</p><p>(Of course, that begs the question as to whether a man might even learn the Enochian language, where he’d learn it, and to what end. The occultists John Dee and Edward Kelley claimed to know the speech of Angels, but neither of them is associated with the Templar tradition.)</p>"

These dice can be used on any roll that the task involves, but the player does not know how many he has to work with (just as the mage doesn’t know how far the orisha’s influence will carry him).

Thus, she can easily heal one of her courtiers, regardless of where it is, but could not cast an offensive spell at other spirits through her subject without an appropriate Space component.</p><p>Any spiritual alliances the mage makes are rendered null and void when the spell expires (at least, spirits don’t uphold their end of any bargains, though many continue to expect the willworker to fulfill her outstanding obligations).

Because of the transcendent nature of spirits of Rank 6 or greater, no Space Arcanum component is necessary to contact the spirit; it simply knows that it is being contacted and either chooses to extrude an avatar or not. If the spirit is unwilling to speak with the summoner, then the spell automatically fails, regardless of successes accrued and Mana spent. Successes equal to five times the avatar’s effective spirit Rank (of 5) are necessary to build the ephemeral shell to be inhabited by a fragment of the royal’s consciousness and power. The caster has no control, whatsoever, over the final Traits of the royal avatar; the royal assigns them, instead, according to its wishes.<p>If, at any point, the royal wishes to terminate contact with the summoner, the spell automatically ends, with no roll necessary. Should the royal wish to communicate directly with the willworker, then it may simply shift the totality of its presence to the mage’s location, though such is surpassingly rare. Not only do most spirit royals have no inclination to deal so directly with mortals, but the unscheduled arrival of so potent a being can inflict disastrous incidental consequences on the local Shadow and material realms. Further, entities of equal or greater standing to the royal may view such a move as an infringement against territorial boundaries and retaliate accordingly.</p><p>Casting this spell is an act of hubris, requiring any mage with four or more dots of Wisdom to roll three dice against degeneration.</p>",

        "DescrizioneMiddle": "The mage must touch the target to enact this spell (at Death 3, she can cast this spell at sensory range). The target feels a sudden chill and then a profound feeling of distance and isolation, as though he were miles away from everything in his vicinity. The mage, through the use of the Prime Arcanum, can see “behind” the soul, viewing the Sleeper on a spiritual level so primitive that no part of his individual ego is present. Most mages find the experience profoundly disturbing, because a human being stripped of his individual humanity is simply a great deal of instinct and a little bit of intellect. Thus, it is possible to cast this spell using only the Death Arcanum, which knocks the soul out of joint but does not convey any mystical insight. This glimpse behind the soul lasts only a turn, after which the mage loses focus on the soul and must cast this spell on a different Sleeper in order to see this “proto-soul.”<p>While the mage peers through the gap, the player can make a Gnosis roll. If the roll is successful, the mage regains a spent Willpower point. Doing so too often, however, can have a serious drawback — the mage becomes addicted to what she sees through the gap, and for every week that passes in which she does not successfully use this spell to get a glimpse, she suffers a cumulative –1 dice penalty on all Socialand Mental-related rolls. When this addiction sets in is up to the Storyteller; one possibility is that it occurs as soon as the mage loses a dot of Wisdom from casting this spell. It is safe to assume that most, if not all, Echo Walkers suffer from this addiction.</p><p>The effects on the Sleeper target are long-lasting and brutal. The target becomes depressed, irritable and unable to relate to others as well as he once could. All Social rolls suffer a –1 dice penalty until the Sleeper can realign his soul. Doing this requires the target to reaffirm his connection to the rest of humanity, meaning that some people can correct the damage within a few hours (a loving father, for example, might find that spending an afternoon caring for his children does the trick, while an ER doctor might save someone’s life and repair the damage). Other people can help the person realign his soul — therapy, spiritual counseling or simply positive attention can shift the victim’s soul back into place (this might require a roll of, for instance, Manipulation + Empathy for counseling or Intelligence + Medicine for psychiatric help, though it’s worth noting that pharmaceutical remedies don’t help matters). People who lack the tools to fix the damage themselves, however, often make it worse. Any degeneration rolls made for the victim while the soul is dislodged automatically fail, and any derangements gained are considered severe. The victim often becomes suicidal (or, occasionally, violent) within a week or two.</p><p>A person afflicted by this spell can be detected by the Death 1 “Soul Marks” spell (see p. 135 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>). Any spell that affects the human soul receives a +2 dice bonus when cast upon a Sleeper suffering the effects of Dislodge Soul.</p><p>The Spirit 3 “Restore Lost Soul” spell (see p. 250 of <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>) can also correct the damage that Dislodge Soul causes. Doing so requires the restoring mage to accumulate a number of successes equal to the Potency of the Dislodge Soul spell.</p><p>Casting this spell upon a Sleeper requires a degeneration roll for mages of Wisdom 2 or more.</p><p>This spell cannot be cast upon Awakened targets, although a Death 4 version of this spell can target mages.</p>",

The mage can add Target factors to increase the area.<p>Space-based spells (sympathetic magic, scrying, teleportation and the like) that try to pierce the Ward must exceed the protection’s Potency with their own Potency. Each time one of these spells breaches the Ward, it erodes the Ward’s Potency by one point, reducing its efficacy. Reinforcing a ward is an exception to the normal spellcontrol rules. Successive Ward spells add their excess Potency to the Ward (that is, any Potency in excess of the Ward’s existing Potency), repairing any damage inflicted and perhaps even improving upon defenses. (The defending mage does not need to create a Ward all over again unless it has been destroyed by incoming spells).</p><p><i>Example: Morvran has a Ward with a Potency of 5. His old rival Angrboda uses a sympathetic spell to send a telepathic threat. The Potency of Angrboda’s spell must exceed the Ward’s Potency. Amazingly, Angrboda’s spell has a Potency of 7, so it gets through. Breaching the Ward erodes the Ward by one point of Potency (even though Angrboda’s spell exceeds the Ward’s Potency by two points, the Ward is only lowered by one point with each breach). Morvran casts the Ward spell again, but only points of Potency in excess of those already possessed by the existing Ward shore it back up. That means Morvran needs an exceptional success (five successes), since the Ward now has Potency 4.</i></p><p>The Space 3 “Ban” spell, p. 237, allows a mage to add Bans to his Wards, keeping certain phenomena from insects to motor vehicles from entering his Ward.</p>",

While some of the most intelligent sorts of beasts can apply reason to problem solving, most are restricted to responses determined by biologically pre-programmed protocols. When hungry, they seek food. When afraid, they flee. When cornered, many fight. In fact, these responses are so deeply ingrained and predictable that a mage knowledgeable in the Arcanum of Life can call upon these responses to induce a given animal to react in virtually any way he desires, within the animal’s normal range of behavior. Because it is biologically possible to cow a 600-pound African lion into submission, the mage could, if he so wished, trigger the submission response in such an animal. Likewise, because a Yorkshire terrier has within it the potential to attack with relentless aggression, the mage can compel the dog to attack an adult human with all the fury (if likely none of the success) of a full-grown feral Doberman pinscher defending its territory against a smaller, weaker creature.<p>This is not a mental compulsion, but a delicate manipulation of an animal’s instinctual responses to situations (regulated by brain chemistry and the animal’s glandular system). All this means that a dog can’t, for example, be made to pull a loose strip of tape off of the top of a sealed box in order to open it neatly, since that response requires training and is not a function of the dog’s natural behavioral template. Further, the spell does not create any kind of telepathic bond with the animal; the mage decides what he wants the animal to do. If the action is within the animal’s range of normal behavior and reactions, it can be induced to experience the desired response. A clever mage can use this spell to affect an animal’s emotional state in a manner that practically borders on telepathy, such as triggering a dog’s pack hierarchy instincts to make it regard the mage not only as a member of the pack, but as its alpha.</p>",

Dark, quiet settings or repetitive gentle motion can trigger a body’s sleep reaction, producing melatonin to lull it into a restful state. These physical reactions are autonomic functions to external or internal stimuli, brought about by neural or chemical reactions without need for thought or emotion. By using Trigger Autonomic Function, the mage is able to trip his target’s body’s functions in such a way as to elicit these responses without the need for outside stimuli.<p>With a touch, the mage triggers a chosen body function in the target. Examples include sleep, sneezing, coughing, elimination, arousal/orgasm and “fight or flight.” This reaction is simple, physical and immediate, but with the addition of Time 2, this spell can be used on a delay of up to an hour, allowing the mage to cast it and then remove themselves from the area. Unlike “Trigger the Lizard Brain” (Life 4), this spell triggers only physical (bodily) responses, rather than instinctive emotional reactions.</p><p>Any living target capable of the chosen body function can be targeted. A guard dog could be put to sleep, a visiting dignitary made to soil themselves, or an attacking werewolf affected with a sneezing fit. Vampires or other undead creatures without autonomic functions are not affected by this spell.

The damage the swarm inflicts depends on its density. All sizes listed above deliver one die of bashing damage to anyone within the radius. A swarm can inflict more damage by condensing. Using the success chart above, add one die per step smaller on the chart. For example, a 16-yard-radius swarm (five successes) that condenses to a two-yard radius (two successes) inflicts four dice of bashing damage. Armor is effective only if it covers the full body, and then it provides only half its rating (rounded down).</p><p>In addition, the vermin can be given venom if the caster imposes a –2 dice penalty on the casting roll.

Recording would seem at first to be a selfless or foolish thing to do, but orders are hungry for grimoires with which to teach young mages, and pay for them in favors. Also, certain Mind spells or creatures can take knowledge from a mage’s mind, leaving a void in its place. In case rotes are lost in this way, it’s good to have them “backed up” in a book.<p>The spell’s target number equals one success per Arcanum dot used in the rote to be recorded.

The grimoire’s Duration is lasting; it cannot be dispelled and does not expire unless the grimoire itself is destroyed.</p><p>Grimoires allow mages to learn their contents without requiring a teacher, although the experience point cost is the same. Additionally, the mage can cast a grimoire’s rotes even if he does not personally know the rotes, as long as he references the book during casting. Doing so requires one turn of reference, during which the mage can do nothing but read the book and move up to his Speed. In the following turn, he can cast the rote. If he is interrupted before casting, he must reference the book all over again. If he already knows the rote, referencing the grimoire gives a +1 bonus to casting it.</p><p>Grimoires cannot be copied without going through the same spellcasting process used to create them.

The Pawns attack each other and the enemy mage.<p>Each success a mage scores with her dueling sword does not (and cannot) inflict damage to her enemy’s Willpower. Instead, each success temporarily generates a spirit out of the mage’s raw, emotionally charged magical power. This spirit accumulates traits just as if it had been created using the spell “Goetic Evocation” (see <b>Mage: The Awakening</b>, p. 325). The spirit resembles a cross between the mage’s sword, a spirit common to the local Shadow and the mage herself.</p><p>A Dueling Pawn serves the mage that created it faithfully. It cannot survive outside of a dueling circle, and dissipates the moment that the spell ceases. Dueling Pawns created with the Spirit 3 version of the spell are insubstantial to everyone but the duelists. There is, however, a Spirit 5 version of the spell where the Pawns are substantial to everyone inside the dueling circle.</p><p>Each turn, a dueling mage may use her sword to stack additional successes upon an existing Dueling Pawn, create a new Pawn or order her Pawns to attack or defend any other entity within the dueling circle. A mage can direct any number of Dueling Pawns by mental command as an instant action, but cannot create or enhance more Pawns or cast a spell in the same turn.</p><p>Pawns inflict damage on non-spirits using their own dice pools, but to Willpower first, then Health. They may injure other spirits normally. Any Numina they might acquire that would allow them to inflict direct Health damage conforms to the above rule, instead. A shield Arcanum subtracts dice from attacking Pawns’ dice pools as if it was Armor, but unlike a standard duel, mages may move about the local Shadow to “physically” evade attacks, and gain the benefits of Defense where applicable.</p><p>As they are inextricably linked to the sorcerer’s will, Dueling Pawns can provide energy to stave off psychic defeat. As a reflexive action, a mage can divert Willpower damage that he suffered to the Resistance of a Pawn. If this knocks a Pawn’s Resistance to zero, the mage suffers any excess damage and the Pawn is destroyed. Mages cannot sacrifice Pawns to stave off Health injuries however, so deadly Shadow duels often end in a quick, lethal “checkmate.”</p><p>There are “Sanguine” versions of this spell that allow Dueling Pawns to inflict lethal or aggravated damage.

In the early summer of 1920, while tourists flocked to the shores of the eastern United States, the bitter Obrimos waged war against the blossoming spirits of corruption and vice that were springing up throughout the area. A number of the mages of Phosphorous’ Consilium were against these unprovoked attacks, and more than one chastised the Arrow for creating such a one-dimensional spell; what good would come of such destructive power? They soon found out when one local mystagogue got in over his head. “Dapper” Dave hadn’t intended any harm by it, but whatever it was that he dredged up from the Underworld longed only to destroy. Phosphorous answered its aggression with the fury of her magic, unleashing this brutal spell upon the creature, until it troubled the Consilium no more. After that, folks stopped criticizing the Arrow’s “one-dimensional” approach."

When the spell is cast on a living creature, its Speed trait is doubled or halved per success, but it is not in full control and reflexive Dexterity + Athletics rolls must be made each turn it moves or the subject suffers a knockdown effect (p. 168 of the <b>World of Darkness Rulebook</b>). The creature’s Speed is modified for the spell’s Duration (default of one turn).</p><p>In the case of projectiles, one success is enough to completely halt a projectile halfway in its path (or as close between there and its target as the mage desires). Additional successes can halt it closer and closer to its origin point, and an exceptional success can halt a bullet in the barrel of a gun. For instance, with two successes, a bullet is stopped after it travels only one-quarter the way from the barrel to its intended target (one success stops it halfway, while the second success halves that distance again).</p><p>The mage can affect multiple projectiles by adding extra Target factors. See “Target,” p. 118. Note that in the case of halting multiple bullets from the same gun (such as stopping machine gun fire), use the following special Target factors chart:</p>[TABLE1]",
